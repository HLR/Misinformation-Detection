2,﻿snes-01547,"Manuka honey, as a topical treatment, is better than all known antibiotics.","Study: Manuka honey kills more bacteria than all available antibiotics
Not all honey is created equal.
While the benefits of raw, unprocessed honey have been well-documented over the centuries, Australian researchers have found one type of honey, called Manuka honey, to be better than all known antibiotics.
Manuka honey is produced by bees that forage on the nectar of Leptospermum Scoparium, or New Zealand's Manuka bush, as well as tea trees, native to Australia and New Zealand only.
This remarkable type of honey not only effectively kills bacteria, but none of the bugs killed by it have been able to build up immunity.
In a world where many of the last resort antibiotics are failing against antibiotic-resistant superbugs, Manuka honey may hold the key to fighting resistance issues, saving thousands of lives worldwide.
Manuka honey fights superbugs
Dr. Dee Carter from the University of Sydney's School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences noted that antibiotics not only have short shelf lives, but the bacteria they attack quickly become resistant as well, making them useless over time.
The report, published in the European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, claimed that Manuka honey killed almost every bacteria and pathogen it was tested on.
Unlike all antibiotics available on today's market, none of the bugs tested were able to survive the honey treatment.
According to Dr. Carter, there are particular compounds, like methylglyoxal, in the Manuka honey that cause multi-system failure in the bacteria, killing them before they are able to adapt and build up immunity.
What Manuka honey can do for you
Manuka's biological properties range from antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, antibiotic and wound healing, to immune-stimulatory.
However, what separates Manuka honey from the rest is that its antibacterial powers challenge even the toughest superbugs, such as the life-threatening methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
Manuka honey is marketed for cancer treatment and prevention, high cholesterol, chronic inflammation, diabetes, the treatment of gastrointestinal problems, and eye, ear and sinus infections.
According to one study, published in the scientific journal Peer J, chronic wounds are becoming a major global health problem, due to antibiotic resistance issues.
There is an urgent need for new, effective agents in topical wound care, and honey has shown some great potential in this regard.
For their study, researchers reviewed Manuka honey in particular as an alternative treatment for wounds because of its broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and the inability of bacteria to develop resistance to it.
Their study indicated that honey might prevent bacterial biofilms and eliminate established biofilms.
Furthermore, they reported that Manuka honey could successfully be used to kill all MSSA and MRSA biofilms in a chronic wound, supporting the use of this type of honey as an effective topical treatment for chronic wound infections.
In recent years, word of the biological benefits of Manuka honey has spread to every corner of the world, turning it into one of the most popular superfoods out there.
So, if you are going to spend your money on honey to reap its benefits, make sure you are buying the real thing.",establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> rhetorical tricks </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> establishing legitimacy </s> rhetorical tricks </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> rhetorical tricks </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> rhetorical tricks </s> exaggeration/absolute language,False,"Manuka honey, as a topical treatment, is better than all known antibiotics. </s></s> Study: Manuka honey kills more bacteria than all available antibiotics

5,﻿tron-02200,FDA Confirms DTaP Vaccine Causes Autism in November 2017,"Did FDA really announce that vaccines are causing autism?
Did a vaccine manufacturer admits on its package insert that their vaccination can cause autism as one of many adverse reactions?
According to the FDA's online Biologics Blood Vaccines document, a vaccine manufacturer admits on its package insert that their vaccination can cause autism as one of many adverse reactions.
These adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea.
Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting.
Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequencies or to establish a causal relationship to components of Tripedia vaccine.

Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Concentrates (For Further Manufacturing Use) are produced by The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University (BIKEN), Osaka, Japan, under United States (US) license, and are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. Tripedia vaccine is filled, labeled, packaged, and released by Sanofi Pasteur Inc.
What's in Tripedia?
According to the Tripedia's package insert, some ingredients include: Bovine extract, formaldehyde used to inactivate microorganisms a couple of times, ammonium sulfate, aluminum potassium sulfate and two growth mediums: modified Mueller and Miller is one; the other is Stainer-Scholte medium.
What is the content of these two growth mediums?
Mueller and Miller medium contains:
Glucose, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate dibasic, monopotassium, phosphate, magnesium sulfate hydrate, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, cysteine hydrochloride, tyrosine hydrochloride, uracil hydrochloride, Ca-pantothenate in ethanol, thiamine in ethanol, pyridoxine-hydrochloride in ethanol, riboflavin in ethanol, biotin in ethanol, sodium hydroxide, beef heart infusion (de- fatted beef heart and distilled water), casein [milk protein] solution.
Basically a mixture of sugar, salt, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.
While Stainer-Scholte medium has the following ingredients:
Tris hydrochloride, tris base, glutamate (monosodium salt) [MSG], proline, salt, monopotassium phosphate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ferrous sulfate, ascorbic acid, niacin, glutathione.
The vaccine is formulated without preservatives, but contains a trace amount of thimerosal [(mercury derivative), (≤0.3 μg mercury/dose)] from the manufacturing process.
Each 0.5 mL dose also contains, by assay, not more than 0.170 mg of aluminum and not more than 100 μg(0.02%) of residual formaldehyde.
The vaccine contains gelatin and polysorbate 80 (Tween-80), which are used in the production of the pertussis concentrate.
""Probable cause"" ingredients for adverse reactions include: casein, to which some children are allergic; MSG-an excitotoxin; thimerosal-ethyl mercury; aluminum; formaldehyde; gelatin; and polysorbate 80.

7,﻿tron-01368,Woman Finds Tongue-Eating Parasite in a Can of Tuna,"SEE IT: British mom finds tongue-eating parasite inside can of tuna, experts say
By Meg Wagner
NEW YORK DAILY NEWS
•
Feb 06, 2015 at 11:25 am
A British mom opened up a can of parasites when she tried to make tuna for dinner.
Zoe Butler found a tiny parasite inside a can of tuna - and scientists said it is likely a tongue-eating variety.
The Nottingham mom found the beady-eyed parasite tucked inside a can of Princes tuna chunks last month. She posted images of the alien-like creature on Twitter, hoping someone could identify her unwelcome dinner guest.

A Cymothoa exigua enters a fish through its gills and attaches to the host's tongue. The parasites are not considered harmful to humans.
Hine hasn't inspected the parasite in person and noted that only through a thorough examination could he confirm its identity; but he said the photos suggest it is a tongue-eating louse. Other experts speculated it could be a juvenile crab or a tadpole.

8,﻿snes-06293,Baby Orajel can cause infants to stop breathing and turn blue.,"Dear all,I hope everyone is enjoying their summer.
Some of you already know, but we wanted to make everyone aware of a terrifying experience that we had over the weekend.
Thank g-d, everything’s ok now but we thought friends and family would want to be aware and would want to advise others with babies.
Zane’s been teething pretty badly for the past few days, and we decided to give him Baby Orajel on Sunday afternoon.
We’ve given it to him a few times previously, when his first two teeth cut through, and never had a problem.
Scott and I were both sitting with Zane on the floor in his room when I rubbed a dosage on his upper gum.
Seconds after I gave it to him, he made a face as if he were crying but no noise came out.
I picked Zane up and he immediately went limp in my arms and his face turned blueish.
He was not panicking or gasping for air – he was lifeless.
This lasted for approximately 15 seconds, but felt like an eternity.
Words cannot convey our feelings during that time (or even now, ever) as we attempted to revive our son.
No parent should ever experience such a feeling and no person should ever see something like this happen to a loved one.
Without a doubt it was the scariest moment of our lives.
Ultimately, Zane “came to” and began to cry hysterically.
Thank g-d!!!!!!!!
We spent the evening at the hospital , where Zane underwent numerous tests, all of which came back normal.
We also spoke with Zane’s pediatrician, who stated that she advises against the use of this product because its purpose is to numb and if it gets into an infant’s throat, it may stop them from breathing.
Obviously, we wanted to learn more about this product and why this happened so we conducted some internet research.
Interestingly, we came across some postings of parents with similar experiences.
Further, one website listed a side effect as, “difficulty breathing and grey/blueish face.” Also, when we called Zane’s daycare to let them know what happened, the owner said that she’s heard of this happening before.
It’s surprising then that no such warning is on the bottle and that more people do not discuss the negative and possible deadly implications of the use of this product.
We don’t want to imagine what could’ve happened if we had given this to him at night, in his crib, as we (and many others) have done in the past, and then walked away (although, of course we monitor him throughout the night).
To reiterate, the reason we share the above with you is to strongly advise you to throw away any Baby Orajel products you have at home and please advise your friends and family of the same.
Trust us, it’s not worth the possible side effects.
Best,
Scott and Allison

10,﻿snes-04766,Dryer sheets permeated with fabric softener contain at least seven dangerous toxic chemicals.,"Dryer sheets cause hormone imbalance, neurotoxicity, respiratory problems, and even cancer
April 11, 2016 By Admin
Most commercial dryer sheets are loaded with all sorts of toxic chemicals including Benzyl Acetate, Benzyl Alcohol, Chloroform and Linalool; none of which are good for your health.
In addition to all the chemicals that end up on your skin, when heated, the fumes are also toxic.
These toxins go straight to their brain's most sensitive neurological centers and wreck havoc.
5 Killer Reasons to Ditch Dryer Sheets
Artificial Fragrances
When people use dryer sheets, they are coating their cloths with  artificial chemical perfumes.
These fragrance chemical are really toxic chemicals.
They are known carcinogens that cause liver damage and cancer in mammals.
(study)
In a recent study performed by UW professor Dr. Anne Steinemann, a research team conducted a small study to understand the effects of fragrances in laundry products (both detergent and dryer sheets).
The resultsd discovered  more than 25 VOCs emitted from dryer vents, with highest concentrations of acetaldehyde, acetone, and ethanol (two of which are considered carcinogenic).
To put it in context, one of the carcinogenic VOC's, acetaldehyde, had emissions that would represent 3% of total acetaldehyde emissions from automobiles in the study area.
This is a major omission of toxic chemicals.
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and industry-generated Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) from the 1990s, the following is a list of chemicals in fabric softener products, most in untested combinations.
1.  Alpha-Terpineol-This chemical has been linked to disorders of the brain and nervous system, loss of muscle control, depression, and headaches
2.  Benzyl acetate-Benzyl acetate has been linked to cancer of the pancreas
3.  Benzyl alcohol-This upper respiratory tract irritant can cause central nervous system (CNS) disorders, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and dramatic drops in blood pressure.
4.  Chloroform-Neurotoxic, anesthetic and carcinogenic.
Really toxic to your brain.
Inhaling its vapors may cause loss of consciousness, nausea, headache, vomiting, and/or dizziness, drowsiness.
5.  Ethanol- Another fabric softener ingredient which is on the EPA's Hazardous Waste list and linked to CNS disorders.
6.  Ethyl Acetate-causes headaches and is on the EPA Hazardous Waste list
7.  Linalool-in studies, this chemical caused loss of muscle coordination, nervous system and brain disorders, and depression
8.  Pentane-causes headaches, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, drowsiness, and depression

In addition to all the chemicals that end up on your skin, when heated, the fumes are also toxic.
5 Killer Reasons to Ditch Dryer Sheets
When people use dryer sheets, they are coating their cloths with  artificial chemical perfumes.
These fragrance chemical are really toxic chemicals.
They are known carcinogens that cause liver damage and cancer in mammals.
In a recent study performed by UW professor Dr. Anne Steinemann, a research team conducted a small study to understand the effects of fragrances in laundry products (both detergent and dryer sheets).
The resultsd discovered  more than 25 VOCs emitted from dryer vents, with highest concentrations of acetaldehyde, acetone, and ethanol (two of which are considered carcinogenic).
To put it in context, one of the carcinogenic VOC's, acetaldehyde, had emissions that would represent 3% of total acetaldehyde emissions from automobiles in the study area.
This is a major omission of toxic chemicals.
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and industry-generated Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) from the 1990s, the following is a list of chemicals in fabric softener products, most in untested combinations.
1.  Alpha-Terpineol-This chemical has been linked to disorders of the brain and nervous system, loss of muscle control, depression, and headaches
2.  Benzyl acetate-Benzyl acetate has been linked to cancer of the pancreas
3.  Benzyl alcohol-This upper respiratory tract irritant can cause central nervous system (CNS) disorders, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and dramatic drops in blood pressure.
4.  Chloroform-Neurotoxic, anesthetic and carcinogenic.
Really toxic to your brain.
Inhaling its vapors may cause loss of consciousness, nausea, headache, vomiting, and/or dizziness, drowsiness.
5.  Ethanol- Another fabric softener ingredient which is on the EPA's Hazardous Waste list and linked to CNS disorders.
6.  Ethyl Acetate-causes headaches and is on the EPA Hazardous Waste list
7.  Linalool-in studies, this chemical caused loss of muscle coordination, nervous system and brain disorders, and depression
8.  Pentane-causes headaches, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, drowsiness, and depression

11,﻿snes-00530,President Trump is signing a law legalizing marijuana across the United States.,"Trump Set To Legalize Medical Marijuana In All 50 States
<b> President Trump is set to sign legislation which will make medical marijuana federally legal for terminally ill patients.
The bill, known as the ""Right to Try Act,"" will prohibit the FDA from banning natural cures, and allow patients to try medications that have not been approved by the FDA, but are currently under clinical trial.
Right to Try was passed unanimously by the Senate last summer and by the House of Representatives on Tuesday in a vote of 250 to 169, after Trump personally lobbied for its passage.
Herb reports: The MAPS trial, currently in the second phase of the FDA approval process, is testing the effectiveness of smoked cannabis in veterans with PTSD and meets all of the criteria set out by the Right to Try.
The majority of states already have their own form of Right to Try legislation, with one notable exception being New York.
In Utah, a recently passed law specifically addresses the right of terminally ill patients to try cannabis.
However, because cannabis remains federally prohibited, even if a terminally ill patient has the ""Right to Try"" cannabis on the state level, they're still in violation of federal law.
The Right to Try bill, recently passed by Congress, would change that.
In addition to cannabis, MDMA and psilocybin could also potentially be used by 'eligible patients' since FDA trials of both substances meet the requirements set out in the federal bill.
What's not clear is what illnesses qualify as life-threatening.
It's likely that those details will be hammered out on a state by state basis in jurisdictions that have already passed their own version of Right to Try. The full title of the bill suggests as much stating, ""in accordance with State law...""
However, in states that lack their own local provisions, the new bill appears to leave plenty of room for interpretation and a potential conflict with local drug laws.
Instead, an 'eligible patient' is defined as, ""Diseases or conditions where the likelihood of death is high unless the course of the disease is interrupted; and Diseases or conditions with potentially fatal outcomes, where the endpoint of clinical trial analysis is survival.""
Patients must also have exhausted all existing treatment options and must be unable to participate in the ongoing trials investigating the drug they want access to.
The bill passed on Tuesday after receiving some opposition from Democrats on Capitol Hill who believe that the law will undermine the FDA's processes.
It's likely that President Trump will sign the bill in the coming days since he has personally lobbied Congress for its passage.
In January, Trump even mentioned the bill in his State of the Union Address saying, ""People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure.
It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try.""

Please do NOT turn on A/C as soon as you enter the car. Open the windows after you enter your car and turn ON the air-conditioning after a couple of minutes. A research says the car dashboard, sofa, air freshener emit Benzene, a Cancer causing toxin. In addition to causing cancer, Benzene poisons your bones, causes anemia and reduces white blood cells.

A car parked indoors with windows closed will only contain 400-800 mg of Benzene.

Then one day, he recommended to a woman, wheelchair bound for six years, to have her root canal tooth extracted, even though it appeared to be fine.
She agreed, so he extracted her tooth and then implanted it under the skin of a rabbit. The rabbit amazingly developed the same crippling arthritis as the woman and died from the infection 10 days later. But the woman, now free of the toxic tooth, immediately recovered from her arthritis and could now walk without even the assistance of a cane.
He then went on to show that many chronic degenerative diseases originate from root-filled teeth - the most frequent being heart and circulatory diseases. He actually found 16 different causative bacterial agents for these conditions. But there were also strong correlations between root-filled teeth and diseases of the joints, brain and nervous system.

File photo of a woman photocopying her breasts.
A 25-year old Singaporean woman is recovering in hospital after an attempted prank involving a photocopier backfired painfully for her yesterday afternoon.
According to local media reports, the woman was dared by her friends to strip naked and run inside a convenience store in Bishan.
Once inside, she was to take a photocopy of her breasts using the store's machine.
Despite her initial reluctance, the woman agreed to the dare after her friends called her a coward.
Speaking to the media, one her friends spoke of her regret for being involved in the incident.
""We thought it was just a harmless prank,"" she told journalists.
""If we knew she would get hurt, we would never had dared her to do it.""
The convenience store clerk, who witnessed the incident, told of his shock at seeing a naked woman running into the store.
""She ran past the counter and went straight to the photocopier,"" he said.
The clerk explained that he watched on, powerless to intervene as the woman lifted the tray of the photocopier and placed her breasts on the glass.
""It must have been cold because gave out a little cry as they touched the glass,"" he said.
According to the clerk, there was a moment of silence as the copier's beam scanned across the woman's breasts.
""The woman started screaming and cursing,"" he said, and he quickly rushed to her aid.
""Her breasts were bright red,"" he told journalists.
""The beam of light from the copier must have burned them."" The clerk grabbed a bottle of water from a nearby fridge and splashed it over the woman's breasts.
Her friends, who had been waiting outside, rushed into the store to see what was taking so long.
""We called for help immediately,"" said her friend who spoke to journalists.
""We were so shocked that she'd been burned by the copier.
We didn't anticipate that at all."" The woman was rushed to hospital where doctors treated her burnt skin.
""We would strongly advise people to never place their body parts on a photocopier,"" said one of the medical team who treated the injured woman.
""In particular, sensitive areas such as the breasts or genitals are very susceptible to being burnt by the light emitted by copiers.
For the woman involved in the incident, the medical staff are confident she'll make a quick recovery.
""The quick actions of the clerk by dousing her breasts in cold water should limit the extent of the burns,"" said a doctor.
For his role in helping the woman, the convenience store clerk is being hailed as a hero.
""I was just doing my job,"" he told journalists.
""As long as she makes a full recovery, that's all I am worried about.""

Let's say it's 4:17 p.m. and you're driving home, (alone of course) after an unusually hard day on the job.  Not only was the work load extraordinarily heavy, you also had a disagreement with your boss, and no matter how
hard you tried, he just wouldn't see your side of the situation. You're really upset and the more you think about it, the more up-tight you become.

All of a sudden you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to radiate out into your arm and up into your jaw.  You are only about five miles from the hospital nearest your home, but unfortunately you don't know if you'll be able to make it that far. What can you do?

You've been trained in CPR but the guy that taught the course neglected to tell you how to perform it on yourself.

HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE (since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack, this article seemed in order.)

Without help - the person whose heart stops beating properly and who begins to feel faint has only about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness.   However, these victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and very vigorously.

A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest.  A breath and a cough must be repeated about every two seconds without let up until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating normally again.

Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing movements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating.  The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm.  In this way, heart attack victims can get to a phone and, between breaths, call for help.

Tell as many other people as possible about this, it could save their lives!

25,﻿snes-04356,Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein has stated that she opposes the use of vaccines.,"Tuesday, she was on hand at the Democratic convention to meet aggrieved Sanders delegates, some of whom formed a small crowd around her to chant, “Bernie or Jill.” Thanks to progressive grassroots rage, she may well peel off a few percentage points of the vote come the fall, when she’s expected to be on the ballot in about 47 states.
Some of the ideas, like a $15 minimum wage and free college tuition, are mainstream these days, thanks to the work of progressive activists and Sanders himself.
Again, this is somewhat standard stuff on the far left these days, but coming from a physician, it’s discouraging.
Despite clearly understanding that vaccines are safe, Stein is pandering to her audience by telling them their worries are justified and offering fuel for those fears by painting a dark picture of a corrupt regulatory apparatus.
Vaccination has worked for many, many years.” He went on to note, “I am sensitive to the fact that there are some families who disagree but the difficulty is if I have a kid who is suffering from an illness who is subjected to a kid who walks into a room without vaccines that could kill that child and that’s wrong.”
During a June interview with Cenk Uygur, Stein explained her strategy for wooing voters more or less boiled down to promising them she would forgive their student loans.
“There are 43 million young people, and going into middle age and beyond, who are trapped in predatory student loan debt,” she said.
Student loans, Stein explained, “should be canceled in the same way that the debt of Wall Street was canceled, essentially writing it off as a digital ‘hat trick,’ which is done in the form of quantitative easing.”
Wait, write off student loans through quantitative easing?
Here is Stein describing her understanding of the Wall Street bailout and explaining how it relates to her student loan plan:
… Forget about the free loans and just consider the debt that was canceled.
It’s simply a debt that was bought up by the U.S. government, and then essentially zeroed out, canceled.
It’s essentially that the government has bought up that loan and it tears up the contract.
(Among other things, holding onto the debts, rather than canceling them, was a key part of how the Fed planned to contain inflation down the line.) Stein’s description is so far off, it’s as if someone asked her how to play basketball, and she answered that teams scored points by kicking the ball off the backboard.
If Stein is trying to simplify the “secret bailout” story so she can say the government is going to do for students what the Fed did for the banks, then she’s lying about the details of a conspiracy theory.
But Occam’s razor suggests Stein probably just has no idea what she’s talking about.
Finally, I would be remiss not to note the plainly self-interested way in which Stein elides the differences between the Democratic and Republican parties.","rhetorical tricks </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> claims without evidence </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> lack of citation for evidence </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> politicizing health issues </s> ingroup vs. outgroup </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> establishing legitimacy </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks",False,"Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein has stated that she opposes the use of vaccines. </s></s> Tuesday, she was on hand at the Democratic convention to meet aggrieved Sanders delegates, some of whom formed a small crowd around her to chant, “Bernie or Jill.” Thanks to progressive grassroots rage, she may well peel off a few percentage points of the vote come the fall, when she’s expected to be on the ballot in about 47 states.

26,﻿tron-01817,Weight Loss Claims About Garcinia Cambogia,"How garcinia cambogia can help you lose weight
You may have seen it listed as an ingredient in weight-loss supplements and wondered what it is.
But even if you don't use it in your fruit salad, you may be interested in this fruit's power as a fat-burning and appetite-suppressing supplement.
In fact, garcinia cambogia may be the weight loss boost that you need to support your healthy eating and exercise efforts.
The weight-loss ingredient found in garcinia cambogia is called hydroxycitric acid, or HCA, which is found in the fruit's rind.
Many studies have examined HCA and found that it can have some substantial benefits for people who are trying to lose weight and get healthier.
How garcinia cambogia helps with weight loss
Since the 1990s, garcinia cambogia has been studied as a weight-loss and fat-burning supplement.
Many studies have consistently found that people who took garcinia cambogia lost more weight than those who didn't take it.
Garcinia cambogia can help a person reduce total fat, including stubborn belly fat, as demonstrated by a double-blind study.
There were no side effects reported by the study participants.
The best results were seen after 16 weeks of taking the supplement, and the study found no ""rebound"" effect of gaining the fat back afterward.
Several studies found that HCA can help people eat less and lose weight by regulating serotonin in the brain.
This helps a person feel full and may help with fat-burning ability.
Overall, garcinia cambogia was found to be more effective than a placebo in suppressing appetite and reducing BMI.
Garcinia cambogia with chromium benefits
An HCA and chromium combination, which is found in our Garcinia Cambogia with Chromemate supplement, was shown to have significant weight-loss benefits as well.
One study found that after 8 weeks, people who took the supplement had reductions in:
o Body weight and BMI
o Total cholesterol
Meanwhile, these same people saw increases in HDL (good) cholesterol and serotonin levels.
How garcinia cambogia boosts your health
Several studies have found that garcinia cambogia helps lower blood cholesterol levels.
In fact, garcinia cambogia was found to be more effective than other plant flavonoids in lowering cholesterol, without toxic side effects.
Garcinia cambogia is also known to have anti-inflammatory power, as well as the ability to reduce blood sugar.
It has a protective effect on the digestive tract, which may help prevent problems like stomach ulcers.
Are there side effects?
While some weight-loss supplements like ephedra have been shown to be unsafe, garcinia cambogia does not have the same risk.
But as with any weight-loss supplement, you will find the most success if you work with a medical professional who can guide you through the weight loss process and help you find the best solutions for your unique needs.
And, if you have diabetes or other health conditions, talk to a doctor before taking any new supplements.
Garcia Weight Loss and Wellness Centers offer our very own garcinia cambogia supplement with chromium to boost weight loss efforts by supporting lean body mass and healthy metabolism.

In fact, garcinia cambogia may be the weight loss boost that you need to support your healthy eating and exercise efforts.
The weight-loss ingredient found in garcinia cambogia is called hydroxycitric acid, or HCA, which is found in the fruit's rind.
Many studies have examined HCA and found that it can have some substantial benefits for people who are trying to lose weight and get healthier.
How garcinia cambogia helps with weight loss
Since the 1990s, garcinia cambogia has been studied as a weight-loss and fat-burning supplement.
Many studies have consistently found that people who took garcinia cambogia lost more weight than those who didn't take it.
Garcinia cambogia can help a person reduce total fat, including stubborn belly fat, as demonstrated by a double-blind study.
The best results were seen after 16 weeks of taking the supplement, and the study found no ""rebound"" effect of gaining the fat back afterward.
Several studies found that HCA can help people eat less and lose weight by regulating serotonin in the brain.
An HCA and chromium combination, which is found in our Garcinia Cambogia with Chromemate supplement, was shown to have significant weight-loss benefits as well.
One study found that after 8 weeks, people who took the supplement had reductions in:

BREAKING: San Diego Declares EMERGENCY… 15 DEAD, 400 HOSPITALIZED
SEPTEMBER 3, 2017
BY DEAN JAMES
Dean James AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS–
The ultra liberal city of San Diego, California which incidentally is inundated with illegal aliens is facing a health crisis and authorities have declared PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.
A public health emergency was declared Friday over an outbreak of ‘hepatitis A’ that has been linked to at least 15 deaths and 400 hospitalizations.
The liver disease outbreak started last November, with the homeless population affected most.
The emergency declaration will help the city access state funds and provide legal protection for new sanitation measures, the Union-Tribune reported.
Areas with high concentrations of homeless people will receive roughly 40 portable hand-washing stations to help combat the disease, which can spread through fecal matter when people fail to thoroughly clean their hands after using the restroom.
Crews also plan to use bleach-spiked water for high-pressure washing to remove “all feces, blood, bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces,” according to a sanitation plan outlined in a letter Thursday.
Other cities in the region can expect to see similar hand-washing and street-sanitizing efforts, said Dr. Wilma Wooten, the region’s public health officer, FOX News reported.
After previous vaccination and educational programs failed to significantly reduce the infection rate, and with death reports spiking in recent weeks, San Diego decided to mimic a campaign used in Los Angeles, which is home to tens of thousands of homeless, in an attempt to curb the outbreak.
“We know that L.A. has had no local cases of hepatitis A related to the strain that we’re seeing here in San Diego,” Wooten said.
“If they’re doing it there and they haven’t had any cases, it could be beneficial here as well.”
The moves in San Diego follow finger-pointing between city and county officials, with both sides insisting they were doing the best they could under tough circumstances, the newspaper said.
“There is no precedent for this,” Wooten said.
“We will definitely have a playbook for if we have something like this in the future.
But this is the first time we have had something of this nature happen.”
These kind of problems are typical in liberal cities.

30,﻿snes-02527,Scientific studies demonstrate that the process of adding fluoride to public water reduces the IQ of the individuals in those areas.,"Corbella: Fluoride doesn't belong in our water supply
[Image] Calgary City council is again considering fluoride in Calgary's tap water after studies show more cavities in Calgary children.
When our twin sons were born in 1997, the City of Calgary had been adding one part per million of fluoride to our drinking water, which began in 1991.
Back then, health officials declared that the “science was settled” and I, like many other Calgarians, stupidly and unthinkingly believed their earnest declarations that adding fluoride to our water supply was “a safe and effective way” to battle tooth decay.
Calgary decided to decrease the amount of fluoride in our water to 0.7 ppm — a 30 per cent drop.
By then, however, it was too late for my sons, both of whom have evidence of dental fluorosis on their permanent teeth — white chalky-looking spots — which is an indication that their bones have also been weakened as well as their teeth by this so-called safe and effective cavity-preventing additive to our water.
Needless to say, my deference to the medical establishment with regard to the safety and effectiveness of fluoride in our water supply was pulled out by the roots and turned on its crown when I realized my children had been harmed by this anti-choice policy.
Because unlike most drugs — and yes, fluoride is defined as a drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — where a doctor prescribes the dose and frequency, it’s impossible to know how much fluoride a person is ingesting when it’s added to our water supply.
Speaking of babies and fluoride, in 2006 the American Dental Association recommended that parents not prepare baby formula with fluoridated water, something that the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S. continues to recommend.
Even though I tried to mostly nurse, we supplemented with formula made with fluoridated water for our sons.
One of the main arguments made for fluoridating our water is to prevent cavities in underprivileged children.
Next Wednesday at 1 p.m., the City of Calgary’s community and protective services committee will receive a report of new evidence on the merits of fluoridation gathered by the University of Calgary’s O’Brien Institute for Public Health.
The main reason fluoride was removed from Calgary’s drinking water in 2011 was because council was being asked to upgrade the fluoride-adding equipment at Calgary’s Glenmore and Bearspaw water treatment facilities.
Oh, and as for that settled science, numerous reports published since Calgary removed fluoride from our water indicates that too much fluoride is linked to lower IQs in children exposed in utero, cognitive issues, kidney problems, endocrine failure, and the list goes on.
In February, Dr. William Ghali, of the O’Brien Institute, told council that the debate over fluoridation requires balancing individual rights and collective protections, drawing comparisons to vaccinations and cellphone use while driving.
Obviously, adding fluoride to our water supply is not at all like driving while using a cellphone.

When our twin sons were born in 1997, the City of Calgary had been adding one part per million of fluoride to our drinking water, which began in 1991.
Back then, health officials declared that the “science was settled” and I, like many other Calgarians, stupidly and unthinkingly believed their earnest declarations that adding fluoride to our water supply was “a safe and effective way” to battle tooth decay.
By then, however, it was too late for my sons, both of whom have evidence of dental fluorosis on their permanent teeth — white chalky-looking spots — which is an indication that their bones have also been weakened as well as their teeth by this so-called safe and effective cavity-preventing additive to our water.
Needless to say, my deference to the medical establishment with regard to the safety and effectiveness of fluoride in our water supply was pulled out by the roots and turned on its crown when I realized my children had been harmed by this anti-choice policy.

A 27 year old woman has died in excruciating agony after she was embalmed alive due to a horrific medical blunder.
Ekaterina Fedyaeva's mother has accused medics of 'murder' after they put her daughter on a formalin drip - a solution contain formaldehyde - instead of saline.
The woman had been in hospital in her home city of Ulyanovsk in Russia for routine surgery.
She was given a drip normally infused into the veins of the dead to prevent decomposition.
Ekaterina suffered horrible pains and convulsions for two days before falling into a coma.
She was attached to a life support machine and her heart stopped several times.
After being flown to a top Moscow hospital, she woke up from her coma - but finally died of multiple organ failure.
Her mother Galina Baryshnikova and husband Igor were with her when she came round from the surgery in her ward.
'Her legs were moving, she had convulsions, her whole body was shaking,' said her mother.
'I put socks on her, then a robe, then a blanket but she was shivering to such an extent, I can't even describe it.
'No doctor came to see her although she was coming round from anaesthetic.'
She suffered chronic stomach pains and vomiting.
The bereaved mother said: 'We had no idea it was formalin.
'And they knew very well that they washed up her body with a poison - and they did nothing to help...
'Now I understand that formalin was simply eroding her body from inside.
'People who performed the surgery already knew that they infused something wrong.
'They needed to take some urgent measures - but they did nothing.'
She begged doctors to help - but they told her to go home, cook chicken soup and stop worrying.
'I begged - 'please help her, she is my only child',' said Galina.
'I think they just wanted me to go away and to hide everything.'
Overnight Ekaterina was rushed to intensive care as her condition deteriorated.
'For 14 hours after surgery she was living with this formalin and they did nothing,' she said.
What is formaldehyde and how is it dangerous to humans?
Formaldehyde was declared a carcinogen by the US government in 2011 but is widely used as part of  embalming fluid to preserve dead bodies.
Formalin, made up of around 37 per cent formaldehyde, is a colourless, strong-smelling chemical substance used in industry and well known to preserve human corpses.
Embalmers inject at least 11.3 litres of the fluid into the cadaver's arterial system and body cavity to slow decay for burial ceremonies.
Drinking 30 milliliters of formalin can kill an adult, while drinking doses of concentrated formaldehyde can cause death from respiratory failure or lead to a coma.
It can also cause convulsions, stomach pain, diarrhea, vomiting, vertigo and a host of other side effects.

33,﻿snes-02999,Studies have proved that having an abortion increases a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.,"In spite of these statistics, many women are being kept in the dark about a preventable risk factor of breast cancer: abortion.
Is abortion a risk factor for breast cancer?
Increased levels of estrogen during pregnancy cause a woman's breasts to enlarge with cells that will eventually allow for milk production.
If a woman has an abortion before her 3rd trimester of pregnancy, her breasts are left with more undifferentiated cells that are more vulnerable to cancer than if she had never been pregnant.
Researchers have found that most miscarriages don't raise the risk of breast cancer because these pregnancies don't produce enough estrogen, which is the driving factor behind the proliferation of undifferentiated, cancer-vulnerable cells.
Fifty-eight out of 74 worldwide studies dating back to 1957 have shown that abortion increases a woman's risk of getting breast cancer.
19 of the 23 studies from the United States show that abortion is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
One study which appeared in the International Journal of Epidemiology in 1989 and relied on New York state medical records reported that abortion increased a woman's risk of getting breast cancer by 90%.
In 1996, Dr. Joel Brind combined the statistics from 23 different worldwide studies and found a 30% increase of breast cancer risk among women who chose abortion after already giving birth and a 50% increase of breast cancer risk among women who chose abortion before giving birth.
A study done on African-American women by researchers at Howard University showed that African-American women over 50 were almost 5 times more likely to get breast cancer if they had abortions compared with women who had never received an abortion.
It is also universally recognized by experts that having a first full-term birth at an early age lowers a woman's risk of getting breast cancer.
Another study published in the Lancet found that breast feeding is another way women can lower their risk of breast cancer.
(5) Women who abort their first pregnancy don't get the protective effects of a first full-term pregnancy and don't receive the protective effects of breast feeding.
Pro-abortion organizations often like to quote a study done on Danish women in an attempt to prove that abortion has no link to breast cancer.
They were trying to determine if abortion caused breast cancer but were including cases of women who had breast cancer 5 years before they recognized abortions as occurring.
It is also noteworthy that in the Melbye study the average age of women procuring an abortion was over the age of 25 while in the United States the average age of women getting abortions at the time of the study was closer to 20.
Even if pro-abortion groups can't accept that abortion takes the life of an innocent human being they should at least warn women of the possible risks relating to breast cancer that having an abortion can cause.

Tuesday November 1 2016 by Timfly
We previously reported about the current tuna recall and the reason for the recall was supposedly a packing deviation by a facility not owned or operated by Bumble Bee that could result in contamination by spoilage or pathogens - if consumed this could lead to life-threatening illnesses... Now there are new reports a man was mixed into a batch of tuna! These have been new reports circulating today so we cannot verify them at this time, but here's what sites have been reporting:
Bumble Bee Foods and 2 employees were charged by Los Angeles prosecutors with violating safety regulations in the death of a worker who was cooked in an industrial oven with tons of tuna. José Melena was performing maintenance in a 35 foot long oven at the company's Santa Fe Springs plant when coworkers loaded it with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and turned it on. Temperatures reached 270° during a two-hour process to cook and sterilize the tuna. The body of Melena,62, was found when the oven was opened.
The company, its plant operations director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules that caused a death. The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require: implementing a safety plan; rules for workers entering confined spaces; and a procedure in place to keep machinery or equipment turned off if somebody is working in.
Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside and Florez, 42, of Whittier could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges. Bumble Bee Foods faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million. ""We remain devastated by the loss of her colleague José Melena in the tragic accident,"" company said in a statement. ""We disagree with and are disappointed by the charges filed by the Los Angeles Dist. Atty.'s office.""

DALLAS - A nurse here became the first person to contract Ebola within the United States, prompting local, state and federal officials who had settled into a choreographed response to scramble on Sunday to solve the mystery of how she became infected, despite wearing protective gear, and to monitor additional people possibly at risk.
The news further stoked fears of health care workers across the country, many of whom have grown increasingly anxious about having to handle Ebola cases.
The confirmation on Sunday of the second Ebola case in Dallas - four days after the death on Wednesday of the first patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, a Liberian who arrived in this country in September - opened a new and more frightening chapter in the unfolding public health drama.
While the new Ebola patient was not publicly identified, officials said that she was a nurse who had helped treat Mr. Duncan at a hospital here and that she may have violated safety protocols.
Officials expanded the pool of people they had been monitoring, because the nurse had not been among the 48 health care workers, relatives of Mr. Duncan and others whom they were evaluating daily.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that health officials look more closely at the protective gear that nurses, doctors and hospital assistants use when treating Ebola patients.
The C.D.C. said it would conduct a nationwide training conference call on Tuesday for thousands of health care workers to ensure they would be fully prepared to treat a patient with Ebola.

The nurse had been monitoring herself for symptoms of Ebola, under a regimen prescribed by the C.D.C. Health officials will now investigate who had been in contact with Mr. Duncan after he was admitted to the hospital and while he was in isolation, Dr. Frieden said.
Despite Dr. Varga's reassurances about C.D.C. precautions having been followed, Dr. Frieden said it appeared that the woman had breached safety protocol at the hospital, possibly when removing the protective gear.
But many health workers across the country, seeing images of people in Africa completely encased in full-body hazardous-material suits, have requested similar protection.

In an indication that the White House was taking steps in advance of any possible spread of the disease, Mr. Obama also directed federal officials to make sure that hospitals and health workers across the nation ""are prepared to follow protocols should they encounter an Ebola patient,"" the statement said.

The confirmation on Sunday of the second Ebola case in Dallas - four days after the death on Wednesday of the first patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, a Liberian who arrived in this country in September - opened a new and more frightening chapter in the unfolding public health drama.
While the new Ebola patient was not publicly identified, officials said that she was a nurse who had helped treat Mr. Duncan at a hospital here and that she may have violated safety protocols.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that health officials look more closely at the protective gear that nurses, doctors and hospital assistants use when treating Ebola patients.
The nurse had been monitoring herself for symptoms of Ebola, under a regimen prescribed by the C.D.C. Health officials will now investigate who had been in contact with Mr. Duncan after he was admitted to the hospital and while he was in isolation, Dr. Frieden said.
In an indication that the White House was taking steps in advance of any possible spread of the disease, Mr. Obama also directed federal officials to make sure that hospitals and health workers across the nation ""are prepared to follow protocols should they encounter an Ebola patient,"" the statement said. </s></s> emotional appeals </s> fear </s> narrative with details_details verified to be true </s> emotional appeals </s> fear </s> anxiety </s> fear </s> emotional appeals </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> surface credibility markers -

U.S. hospitals are facing widespread shortages of IV bags in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which damaged and temporarily shut down several Puerto Rico factories owned by a major manufacturer of the bags.
IV bags, used to mix and deliver liquid medications or salt water to patients through an intravenous line, are one of the most highly used items in hospitals. There are workarounds to deal with the lack of the bags, such as injecting medications with a syringe. But experts from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health are concerned that the lack of bags could negatively affect patient care.
Paul Biddinger, director of Harvard Chan School's Emergency Preparedness and Response Exercise Program and chief of the Division of Emergency Preparedness at Massachusetts General Hospital, said in a February 20, 2018 article in The American Prospect that he's worried about cardiology patients, who use blood thinners and anti-arrhythmic drugs, which are often injected via an IV bag.

My best friend's mom works at a pharmacy and she said the drug is available exclusivly to veterinarians to sterilize large animals.
But I have heard from several of my friends that are still in grad school up north that at frat parties at their schools (Columbia and Penn State) the drug is being used with Rohypnol (roofies), the date rape drug.
With Rohypnol, all they have to do is drop it into their drink.
The girl can't remember a thing the next morning of what happened the night before.
Well now Rohypnol is not being used alone.
Progesterex, which dissolves in drinks (alcohol or soda) just as easily, is being used with it so that the woman doesn't conceive from the rape and the rapist doesn't have to worry about having a paternity test identifying him months later.
But the drug's affects AREN'T TEMPORARY.
Progesterex was designed to sterilize horses.
Any woman that takes it WILL NOT HAVE CHILDREN EVER IN HER LIFE.
All guys have to do to get this drug is just know someone, like a friend, who is in the Vet school of any university.
It's that easy, and Progesterex is about to break out big on campuses everywhere.
Believe it or not, there is even a site on the internet for the drug telling people how to use it.
It's at  http://members.theglobe.com/sinister101/index.htm  [URL no longer works].
For more information about ""Roofies"" go to  http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/0884.html.

41,﻿snes-03675,The Amish don't get autism because they do not vaccinate their children.,"The Age of Autism: The Amish anomaly
LANCASTER, Pa., April 18 (UPI) -- Part 1 of 2.
Where are the autistic Amish?
Here in Lancaster County, heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country, there should be well over 100 with some form of the disorder.
I have come here to find them, but so far my mission has failed, and the very few I have identified raise some very interesting questions about some widely held views on autism.
The mainstream scientific consensus says autism is a complex genetic disorder, one that has been around for millennia at roughly the same prevalence.
That prevalence is now considered to be 1 in every 166 children born in the United States.
Applying that model to Lancaster County, there ought to be 130 Amish men, women and children here with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
So let's drop those from our calculation, even though ""mild"" is a relative term when it comes to autism.
That means upwards of 50 Amish people of all ages should be living in Lancaster County with full-syndrome autism, the ""classic autism"" first described in 1943 by child psychiatrist Leo Kanner at Johns Hopkins University.
The full-syndrome disorder is hard to miss, characterized by ""markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests,"" according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
Why bother looking for them among the Amish?
The first half-dozen articles in this ongoing series on the roots and rise of autism examined the initial studies and early accounts of the disorder, first identified by Kanner among 11 U.S. children born starting in 1931.
If Kanner was correct -- if autism was new and increasingly prevalent -- something must have happened in the 1930s to trigger those first autistic cases.
Genetic disorders do not begin suddenly or increase dramatically in prevalence in a short period of time.
That is why it is worth looking for autistic Amish -- to test reasoning against reality.
Largely cut off for hundreds of years from American culture and scientific progress, the Amish might have had less exposure to some new factor triggering autism in the rest of population.
Of course, the Amish world is insular by nature; finding a small subset of Amish is a challenge by definition.
Many Amish, particularly Old Order, ride horse-and-buggies, eschew electricity, do not attend public school, will not pose for pictures and do not chat casually with the ""English,"" as they warily call the non-Amish.
Still, some Amish today interact with the outside world in many ways.
So far, from sources inside and outside the Amish community, I have identified three Amish residents of Lancaster County who apparently have full-syndrome autism, all of them children.
A local woman told me there is one classroom with about 30 ""special-needs"" Amish children.
In that classroom, there is one autistic Amish child.
Another autistic Amish child does not go to school.
The third is that woman's pre-school-age daughter.
What I learned about those children is the subject of the next column.

42,﻿snes-05189,Several widely-available cheeses are partially made from wood.,"Yes, parmesan cheese you sprinkle on pasta may contain wood pulp
Mary Bowerman
USA TODAY Network
Parmesan cheese or wood pulp? Chances are when you sprinkle parmesan on your spaghetti you may be getting a little of both.
Some companies that promise 100% parmesan cheese, have been adding cellulose, a common food additive made from wood pulp, to their cheese products, according to an independent study, launched by Bloomberg News.
An independent laboratory test found that products like Walmart store's Great Value 100% grated parmesan cheese registered 7.8% cellulose, Jewel-Osco’s Essential Everyday 100% parmesan cheese was 8.8% cellulose and Kraft had 3.8% cellulose, Bloomberg reported.
But, while the idea of eating a product that contains wood pulp doesn’t seem appetizing, you probably do it more than you think.
Cellulose, which is indigestible and present in all plant food, is many times added to food to give texture, according to John Coupland, a Pennsylvania State University professor of food science and president-elect of the Institute of Food Technologists.
Coupland said companies could use powdered cellulose from celery or broccoli in their products, but it would be a waste of food.
“It’s extracted and ground up like a powder, that doesn’t dissolve in water, and doesn’t taste like anything,” Coupland said.
The lack of taste is part of the reason it's found in many shredded cheese products.
“The powdered cellulose in shredded cheese prevents the cheese from sticking together and getting oily,” Coupland said.
The study comes in the wake of a drawn-out FDA investigation into Castle Cheese Inc., a company which falsely claimed to produce 100% parmesan cheese, but used a high percentage of cellulose and a mixture of other cheeses, duping customers.
After the FDA investigation, the company discontinued the products and filed for bankruptcy in 2014, Bloomberg notes.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially given the checkmark of approval to cannabidiol, a relaxing compound in medical marijuana, ruling it is not a dangerous drug.
The compound, also known as CBD, can be an effective treatment for cancer, Alzheimer's, epilepsy and in palliative care, with WHO now ruling it does not have any risks of addiction.
The ruling means that it should not be a scheduled drug - meaning that it is not a drug that has a high potential for abuse or is illegal to manufacture or distribute.
The WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence announced: ""Recent evidence from animal and human studies shows that its use could have some therapeutic value for seizures due to epilepsy and related conditions.
""Current evidence also shows that cannabidiol is not likely to be abused or create dependence as for other cannabinoids (such as Tetra Hydro Cannabinol (THC), for instance).""
The organization is now set to launch a more complete review in May of next year to look into cannabis and cannabis-related substances.
Currently, anyone found possessing cannabis can be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both punishments under UK legislation.

46,﻿snes-03912,Snacks marketed to children are heavily laden with ingredients that cause cancer.,"BEWARE: TOP 5 POTENTIALLY CANCER-CAUSING CHILDREN'S SNACKS MADE FROM PETROLEUM-BASED PRODUCTS
Companies market food directly to children through T.V. and radio commercials, the internet, magazines, toys, clothing, and even through product placement in movies and video games.
$10 billion to ensure that kids pick the extra-sugary cereal with the movie character on the box, or the fruit snacks full of artificial preservatives that are shaped like animals from the zoo.
Marketing to children works and the fact is that the overwhelming majority of marketing directed at children is for foods with poor nutritional quality that are potentially dangerous to their health.
We know that most of these products fall into the ""junk food"" category, but how exactly are the ingredients in these snacks affecting our health?
Many of the popular snacks kids love contain artificial food coloring to make the food look more appealing to children - allowing them to ""taste the rainbow"" and have fun with their food.
Yellow 5 (tartrazine) and Red 40 are just two of the commonly used food dyes made from petroleum, which is used to enhance products such as Fruit Loops, Jell-O, Kool-Aid, macaroni and cheese, popsicles, fruit roll-ups and Nutri-Grain cereal bars, just to name a few.
These dyes have been linked to serious health problems, including cancer, hyperactivity, and allergic reactions.
Yellow 5 and Red 40 are two out of six food colorings that are banned in the UK, but U.S. companies still use them freely in their products.
The list of products containing these dyes is almost endless, but here are a few to watch out for:
Here are the top 5 popular children's snacks made with petroleum-based ingredients:
The most popular flavor of Pop Tarts, Frosted Strawberry, includes ingredients such as corn syrup, dextrose, sugar and high fructose corn syrup, all of which have been linked to sugar addiction, diabetes and liver problems in children.
These toaster pastries also include TBHQ, a petroleum-based product that causes cellular dysfunction.
The food color most often used in these ""fruit"" flavored snacks is Red 3 or erythrosine, a petroleum product which has been banned for use in cosmetics due to its connection with thyroid tumors.
These popular candies contain a lot more than chocolate, including Blue 1, which can trigger the development of malignant tumors, Blue 2, which can increase hyperactivity and has been linked to brain tumors, Red 40 which can damage DNA, and Yellow 5 and 6 which have been linked to cancer.
The artificial coloring in this snack is made from Yellow 6, which is derived from petroleum, as is the ""cheese"" flavoring, which includes methyl benzoate and ethyl methylphenidate.
The continued use of these artificial dyes in food, especially in children's snacks, poses unnecessary and dangerous health risks that can be avoided by being health conscious and keeping an eye out for artificial coloring in your food.
Your children can still ""taste the rainbow"" - in the form of naturally colorful organic fruits and vegetables.

Hundreds of Canadian doctors, medical specialists and residents, as well as medical students, have signed a petition protesting their own pay raises, instead asking that the money be reallocated to help nurses and patients in need.
""We, Quebec doctors who believe in a strong public system, oppose the recent salary increases negotiated by our medical federations,"" reads the letter, originally posted in French, the official language in the Canadian province.
As of Tuesday, at least 213 general practitioners, 184 specialists, 149 resident medical doctors and 162 medical students had signed the petition, according to CNBC.
""These increases are all the more shocking because our nurses, clerks and other professionals face very difficult working conditions, while our patients live with the lack of access to required services because of the drastic cuts in recent years and the centralization of power in the Ministry of Health,"" the letter said.

Doctors in Canada are protesting a pay raise because they would rather that money be reallocated to help nurses, clerks and needy patients.
The doctors took umbrage with the pay bumps while nurses and clerks were over overburdened and patients faced declining services because of budget cuts to the public health care system.

""We, Quebec doctors, are asking that the salary increases granted to physicians be canceled and that the resources of the system be better distributed for the good of the health care workers and to provide health services worthy to the people of Quebec,"" the letter said.
Canada offers ""universal coverage for medically necessary health care services provided on the basis of need, rather than the ability to pay,"" according to the government's website.
""We believe that there is a way to redistribute the resources of the Quebec health system to promote the health of the population and meet the needs of patients without pushing workers to the end,"" the doctors wrote.
The group that published the February 25 petition, Médecins Québécois Pour le Régime (MQRP), also authored a February 17 letter opposing $500 million in pay increases for specialist doctors, calling the increase raises ""indecent.""

On February 1, the group of doctors published a letter of solidarity supporting their colleagues.
""The subject of nurses' work overload is at the heart of the news following the 'sit-ins,'"" MQRP wrote.
""MQRP joins its voices to those of nurses to denounce this unacceptable situation, which affects the quality of care for the Quebec population and weakens our public health system.""

Hundreds of Puerto Rico's residents qualified for federal disability benefits in recent years because they lacked fluency in English, according to government auditors.
The Social Security Administration's inspector general questioned the policy this month in light of the fact that Spanish is the predominant language in the U.S. territory.
Under Social Security regulations, individuals are considered less employable in the United States if they can't speak English, regardless of their work experience or level of education. In a report this month, the independent watchdog suggested that a more appropriate standard might be to consider local conditions when making benefits decisions.
According to the latest U.S. Census Bureau data, 95 percent of Puerto Rico residents above age 5 speak Spanish at home, and about 84 percent say they do not speak English ""very well.""
The inspector general noted that a nurse in Puerto Rico who speaks only Spanish could be considered ""unskilled"" under current Social Security standards.
""A claimant's inability to communicate in English can lessen the relevance of work experience and education, potentially making it more likely the claimant will receive disability benefits,"" the report said.
Individuals born in Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens, making them eligible to apply for Social Security benefits. However, they do not automatically qualify for disability payments.
Nonetheless, auditors identified 218 cases between 2011 and 2013 in which the the Social Security Administration granted disability status to Puerto Rico residents because of the existing guidelines.
The inspector general recommended that the agency evaluate whether the rules are appropriate and determine the number of beneficiaries who have received disability status based on their inability to communicate in English.
The Social Security Administration agreed with the proposals and said it is making preparations for a potential rule change, including by gathering research and taking input from federal experts and the public.",distinctive linguistic features </s> uppercase words </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> establishing legitimacy,True,"The consumption of poppy seeds used on bagels and muffins can produce positive results on drug screening tests. </s></s> FEDERAL INSIDER

The Social Security Administration agreed with the proposals and said it is making preparations for a potential rule change, including by gathering research and taking input from federal experts and the public. </s></s> distrusting government or corporations </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified"

WASHINGTON - McDonald's will soon begin buying beef from overseas, citing a shortage of the U.S. meat that's lean enough to make burgers, The Associated Press reports.

In doing so, the fast-food chain joins Burger King, Wendy's and others. McDonald's is currently testing the imported beef in about 400 of its 13,000 U.S. restaurants, all in the Southeast, according to the AP.

McDonald's is the biggest single buyer of both U.S. and Australian beef, which the chain uses extensively outside of the United States. Lean beef from Australia and New Zealand sells for 5 cents to 20 cents per pound cheaper than U.S. product, according to the AP.

The National Cattlemen's Beef Association has said it will oppose any attempt by Congress or the Bush administration to allow Australia and New Zealand to increase their U.S. exports, the AP reports. Instead, American producers are trying to persuade the fast-food industry to make its burgers from more expensive but leaner parts of the cow.

""We're more than willing to work with the quick-serve restaurant chains to come up with solutions to their supply needs that involve a domestic product,"" said Kendal Frazier, a spokesman for the producers' group.

In the United States, the lean beef that the fast-food chains need for their burgers usually comes from female cattle that are slaughtered for ground beef when they are too old for breeding or producing milk.

54,﻿snes-06191,"""Ordinary use of canola oil is dangerous to consumers."" 
Original","Recently I bought a cooking oil that's new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in ""bad"" fats.
However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from?
There are plenty of official Canola sites lauding this new ""wonder"" oil with all its low-fat health benefits.
Canola is a genetically engineered plant developed in Canada from the Rapeseed Plant, which is part of the mustard family of plants.
Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.
Rape oil was widely used in animal feeds in England and Europe between 1986 and 1991, when it was thrown out.
What is interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, 'scrapie' disappeared.
We also haven't seen any further reports of ""Mad Cow"" since rape oil was removed from the feed.
US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.
Except canola means ""Canadian oil""; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified.
If the label says, ""may contain the following"" and lists canola oil, you know it contains canola oil because it is the cheapest oil and the Canadian government subsidizes it to industries involved in food processing.
I don't know what you'll be cooking with tonight, but I'll be using olive oil and old-fashioned butter, from a genetically unmodified cow.
Canola oil from the rape seed, referred to as the Canadian oil because Canada is mainly responsible for it being marketed in the USA.
The Canadian government and industry paid our Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) $50 million dollars to have canola oil placed on the (GRAS) List, ""Generally Recognized As Safe"".
No studies on humans were made before money was spent to promote Canola oil in the USA.
Canola oil is a very long chain fatty acid oil (c22).
After a year using Canola oil I tested 260.
She stopped using Canola oil, wondering what it did to our insides if it could not be removed from cloth easily.
Our Father bred birds, always checking labels to insure there was no rape seed in their food.
as a quality control taster at an apple-chip factory where Canola oil was used exclusively for frying, developed numerous health problems.
I said, ""I'll bet anything that you are using Canola oil"".
Rape seed oil is a penetrating oil, to be used in light industry, not for human consumption.
Rape seed oil used for stir-frying in China found to emit cancer causing chemicals.
Canola oil is a health hazard to use as a cooking oil or salad oil.
It is not fit for human consumption, do not eat canola oil, it can hurt you.

Original </s></s> Recently I bought a cooking oil that's new to our supermarkets, Canola Oil. I tried it because the label assured me it was lowest in ""bad"" fats.
However, when I had used half the bottle, I concluded that the label told me surprisingly little else and I started to wonder: where does canola oil come from?
Rape oil, it seems, causes emphysema, respiratory distress, anemia, constipation, irritability, and blindness in animals and humans.
What is interesting is that when rape oil was removed from animal feed, 'scrapie' disappeared.
US and Canadian farmers grow genetically engineered rapeseed and manufacturers use its oil (canola) in thousands of processed foods, with the blessings of Canadian and US government watchdog agencies.
Except canola means ""Canadian oil""; and the plant is still a rape plant, albeit genetically modified.
Canola oil from the rape seed, referred to as the Canadian oil because Canada is mainly responsible for it being marketed in the USA.
The Canadian government and industry paid our Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) $50 million dollars to have canola oil placed on the (GRAS) List, ""Generally Recognized As Safe"".
Rape seed oil is a penetrating oil, to be used in light industry, not for human consumption.",distrusting government or corporations </s> religion or ideology </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> rhetorical tricks </s> emotional appeals </s> freedom of choice and agency </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> freedom of choice and agency </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> politicizing health issues </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> surface credibility markers -

55,﻿tron-02215,Vice Presidential Candidate John Edwards responsible for the flu vaccine shortage?,"Flu Shot Info /Interesting, read to end
How the vaccine works:
Influenza vaccine is produced by growing the virus in eggs. The virus is killed and processed to create the vaccine, which is given by injection under the skin. The body then produces antibodies to the virus over the next two to four weeks. If the immunized person then comes into contact with the influenza virus, the antibodies attack and kill the virus before it has a chance to cause infection. The vaccine contains the 3 most likely strains to be active during the “flu season”
Why the shortage:
Almost half of the nation’s flu vaccine will not be delivered this year. Chiron, a major manufacturer of flu vaccine, will not be distributing any influenza vaccine this flu season. Chiron was to make 46-48 million doses of vaccine for the United States. Chiron is a British company. Recently British health officials stopped Chiron from distributing and making the vaccine when inspectors found unsanitary conditions in the labs. Some lots of the vaccine were recalled and destroyed.
Why is our vaccine made in the UK and not the US?
The major pharmaceutical companies in the US provided almost 90% of the nations flu vaccine at one time. They did this despite a very low profit margin for the product. Basically, they were doing us a favor.
In the late 80’s a man from North Carolina who had received the vaccine got the flu. The strain he caught was one of the strains in that years vaccine made by a US company. What did he do? He sued and he won. He was awarded almost $5 million! After that case was appealed and the appeal was lost, most US pharmaceutical companies stopped making the vaccine. The liability outweighed the profit margin. Since UK and Canadian laws prohibit such frivolous law suits, UK and Canadian companies began selling the vaccine in the US.
By the way…the lawyer that represented the man in the flu shot law suit was a young ambulance chaser by the name of John Edwards.","establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> narrative with details_verified to be false </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> distinctive linguistic features",False,"Vice Presidential Candidate John Edwards responsible for the flu vaccine shortage? </s></s> Flu Shot Info /Interesting, read to end

58,﻿snes-01403,"Canada has legalized euthanasia, enabling parents to ""kill disabled children.""","Canada Legalizes Euthanasia For Parents To Kill Their Disabled Kids
<b> Doctors in Canada have been given the green-light to euthanise disabled, sick or dying children under a controversial new law.
The legislation extends existing 'assisted suicide' laws that have been legal in Canada over a year now, in which adults can legally volunteer to end their own life.
The new legislation passes the responsibility of consensual death for minors over to the parents.
Liftsitenews.com reports: American anti-euthanasia activist Wesley Smith said the results of the survey prove the morally slippery slope that a nation slides down when it agrees that ""killing is an acceptable answer to human suffering.""
The CPS surveyed its members in light of the possibility Canada will expand euthanasia to children.
But the Commons Justice Committee added an amendment to the bill directing the federal government to review expanding euthanasia on three further grounds: for children, or ""mature"" minors; solely for mental illness; and allowing advance directives in the case of those with degenerative diseases such as dementia.
The CPS surveyed 1050 pediatricians on their experiences with ""medical aid in dying"" or MAID, and released a report at the end of October.
Forty-five doctors reported receiving explicit requests from parents to euthanize 91 children, it said.
As for requests from the children themselves, 35 paediatricians reported discussing euthanasia with 60 minors.
Nine reported receiving direct requests for euthanasia from 17 minors.
While ""such consultations may be rare, minors in Canada are contemplating MAID-related concepts and approaching health care providers with MAID-related questions,"" noted the CPS survey.
Thirty-three percent opposed euthanizing mature minors for any reason.
Mature minors are children who are allegedly capable of understanding the nature and consequences of treatment, and so judged competent to request death by lethal injection.
The CPS study suggested non-voluntary euthanasia for non-competent dying ""and/or severely disabled"" children is not far off.
Canada, the parents of a dying and/or severely disabled child who is deemed to be suffering may, in the near future, be looking to the courts to support a right to end their child's life.
Euthanasia lobbyists shift the argument for legalizing the killing of children by lethal injection from the autonomy of the individual to ""why do you want to allow them to suffer,"" he told LifeSiteNews.
""So the idea is, well, this isn't fair, the law has an inequality because you're allowing adults who are capable of requesting this, but not children or mature minors.""
Parents and guardians in Canada currently can authorize no treatment or the withdrawal of treatment for non-competent minors, Schadenberg added.
""If you had a child with a significant disability, then the question at birth would be, do you want that child to receive treatment or not, and you would have the right to say yes or no,"" he said.
Schadenberg echoed Smith's warning that once euthanasia is allowed, the grounds for legally killing people keep expanding, as has been demonstrated in other jurisdictions.

There was also a note that said, ""You have been infected with HIV"". The Centers for Disease Control reports that similar events have taken place in several other cities recently.

Please don't eat bananas for the next 3 weeks
Several deliveries of bananas from Uvongo Kwa-Zulu Natal South Africa have been infected with necrotizing fasciitis, otherwise known as flesh eating bacteria. Recently this disease has decimated the monkey population in the south coast. We are now just learning that the disease has been able to graft itself to the skin of fruits in the region, most notably the banana which is one of south africa's largest exports. Until this finding scientists were not sure how the infection was being transmitted. It is advised not to purchase bananas for the next three weeks!!! If you have eaten a banana in the last 2-3 days and come down with a fever followed by a skin infection seek MEDICAL ATTENTION!!!
The skin infection from necrotizing fasciitis is very painful and eats two to three centimeters of flesh per hour. Amputation is likely, death is possible.. If you are more than an hour from a medical center burning the flesh ahead of the infected area is advised to help slow the spread of the infection.

62,﻿snes-02154,"The bite of a rare breed of tick most commonly called the lone star tick can cause itching, stomach cramps, breathing difficulties, and an allergic reaction to red meat.","After enduring one misdiagnosis after another, Dotoli finally learned from a blood test that he had become allergic to meat, pork and dairy - the very allergens he'd been happily ingesting nearly every day.
Most likely a bite from <a> the Lone Star tick <a>.
The Lone Star tick is ""more of an annoyance than an important disease vector,"" said Tom Mather, director of the University of Rhode Island's <a> TickEncounter Resource Center.
When it comes to dangerous illnesses, as opposed to allergies, the Lone Star can transmit a Lyme-like disease called <a> human ehrlichiosis, <a> but that strikes only three people out of a million, and is fatal only one percent of the time, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
There is no official count of how many people now suffer from the allergy, but allergists in different regions of the country each report cases in the hundreds.
The Lone Star is a very aggressive biter, and its bites typically come with a wicked itch - a telltale sign.
The Lone Star has become common in the southern part of New Jersey, especially along the eastern, coastal counties, Mather said.
Dotoli's allergy, called Alpha-gal (rhymes with ""pal""), can be hard for meat-lovers to recognize because beef and pork are so prevalent in their diets, said the allergy researcher who <a> played a major role in discovering it.
People come in and tell us they're allergic to shrimp, and they're usually right,"" said <a> Thomas Platts-Mills <a>, of the University of Virginia School of Medicine.
While a person allergic to peanuts will know something's amiss within 15 minutes of eating peanuts, someone with Alpha-gal won't sense any reaction at least two hours, with four or five hours being more common, he said.
In his research, Platts-Mills was able to see that the lab tests showing the unusual antibody triggering the allergy appeared only in a broad swath of the eastern and southern United States.
The range of the Lone Star tick (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
When Platts-Mills and his team took a closer look at patients in some of those states, they found the allergy present in people who seemingly led very different lives - from a socialite to an air-conditioning repairman.
It is unknown how many people suffer from the Alpha-gal allergy, although Platts-Mills said he has heard reports from Long Island allergists of 300 cases in that region alone.
In an odd twist of fate, Platts-Mills came down with the allergy himself after researching it - a development made evident to him when he broke out in hives six hours after eating some lamb chops in London.
He said his heart goes out to children who come down with the allergy and have to learn to restrict their diets.
There is a small chance the allergy will disappear in about five years if Dotoli avoids further tick bites.

A vaccine for type 1 diabetes developed by Finnish researchers will be tested on mainly Finnish human subjects in late 2018, researchers announced on Tuesday.
that the vaccine could be in mainstream use within eight years if the coming rounds of tests prove successful.
After two successful rounds the vaccine can be considered safe and effective against viruses.
The final round of vaccinations, intended for a group of some 4,000 children, should tell researchers whether the vaccine specifically prevents type 1 diabetes.
A virus may be behind a significant proportion of type 1 diabetes cases, which are especially common among children.
Professor Heikki Hyöty from the University of Tampere and Professor Mikael Knip of the University of Helsinki have worked on the pathology of diabetes from more than 20 years, and say they are confident that an enterovirus that attacks the pancreas to destroy insulin-producing cells is the root cause of type 1 diabetes.
The insulin-producing cells marked in green are destroyed by diabetes.

If the vaccine proves effective in humans, it could do much to minimise suffering as well as expenses.
""It is estimated that the additional cost of care for one child with diabetes over their lifetime is about a million euros,"" Knip says.
""This vaccine could prevent at least half of new cases, which amounts to some 250 million euros in annual savings.""
Enteroviruses are the most common type of infectious virus in humans; they cause a wide variety of health problems from the flu and eye infections to meningitis and heart inflammation.
Humanity last beat back an enterovirus via vaccination when polio was all but eradicated in the late 1980s.
The team of researchers sought funding for their vaccine trial for four years, with no European benefactors stepping up.
Eventually American biopharmaceutical company Provention Bio agreed to fund the trial in full.
The company has raised just under 25 million euros, most of which will go towards seeing the vaccination trials through.
They are part-owners of the firm, which has given Provention Bio the green light to use and manage their enterovirus vaccine.
""The only way to change years of university study into a working vaccine is through business cooperation,"" says Hyöty.
""Human trials are so expensive that only a large enough international company with enough room for risk management to be prepared in case the vaccine is found wanting.""

Ever since the government began its quest to ""normalize"" homosexuality and other perverse sexual behavior, conservatives have been saying it's a slippery slope. After what happened at an academic conference at the University of Cambridge, it's safe to say they were right.
The ""Classifying Sex: Debating DSM-5"" conference featured speakers who condoned pedophilia as ""natural and normal for males.""
A proposal was being discussed which would essentially normalize hebephilia, the sexual preference for children in early puberty, typically 11 to 14-year-olds. The argument was made that since children are reaching puberty earlier than ever before, sex with 11 to 14-year-olds should not be considered wrong.
That this was even a topic of discussion among the worlds leading psychiatrists is incredibly alarming, but the conference took matters one step further by claiming that ""at least a sizable minority of normal males would like to have sex with children, and normal males are aroused by children.""
Ultimately, the proposal to include hebephilia as a legitimate disorder in the new edition of the American Psychiatric Association manual was defeated, and sex offenders are thrilled.
Tom O'Carroll, who is a multiple child sex offender, longtime campaigner for the legalization of sex with children and former head of the Paedophile Information Exchange, wrote about how ""wonderful"" both the conference and resulting proposal defeat were on his blog.

Ever since the government began its quest to ""normalize"" homosexuality and other perverse sexual behavior, conservatives have been saying it's a slippery slope. After what happened at an academic conference at the University of Cambridge, it's safe to say they were right.
The ""Classifying Sex: Debating DSM-5"" conference featured speakers who condoned pedophilia as ""natural and normal for males.""
A proposal was being discussed which would essentially normalize hebephilia, the sexual preference for children in early puberty, typically 11 to 14-year-olds. The argument was made that since children are reaching puberty earlier than ever before, sex with 11 to 14-year-olds should not be considered wrong.
That this was even a topic of discussion among the worlds leading psychiatrists is incredibly alarming, but the conference took matters one step further by claiming that ""at least a sizable minority of normal males would like to have sex with children, and normal males are aroused by children.""
Ultimately, the proposal to include hebephilia as a legitimate disorder in the new edition of the American Psychiatric Association manual was defeated, and sex offenders are thrilled.

65,﻿snes-01314,"After shaving her legs, a woman developed a life-threatening skin infection that required the removal of massive amounts of skin and muscle tissue.","Mother-of-three, 44, develops deadly infection and nearly loses her legs after trimming her PUBIC HAIR with a brand new razor
A mother-of-three has spoken of her terror after she almost lost her legs to a deadly infection which she caught from shaving her bikini line.
Dana Sedgewick, 44, from Sheffield, trimmed her pubic area with a brand new razor but ended up cutting a spot on her groin.
Her body almost immediately went into shock, causing a red rash on her legs before they turned black from necrotising fasciitis - a flesh-eating infection.
Rushed to intensive care, doctors operated to remove as much of the rotting skin as they could - but she developed sepsis during the procedure.
She was placed in a coma as her family were told she had just a 30 per cent chance of survival as her kidneys failed and her heart stopped four times.
Having managed to survive the horrific ordeal, she underwent 21 operations to repair the damage to her skin - but doctors warned she would never walk again.
Mrs Sedgewick said: 'Like a lot of women, I tried to keep a tidy bikini line.
Later that day, her eldest daughter Megan discovered her lying in bed, with her legs covered in a bloody red rash.
An ambulance was called and she was rushed to the trauma unit at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, where doctors diagnosed her with necrotising fasciitis.
Mrs Sedgewick said: 'By the time I got to the hospital, my legs were covered in black, rotting flesh.
During surgery, she developed sepsis and was given a slim chance of survival after going into septic shock.
To increase her chances of survival, doctors decided to put her into an induced coma for nine days.
She said: 'When I woke up, my legs were covered in bandages and I had no idea what had happened.
'But when the surgeon asked me if I remembered shaving, I suddenly recalled trimming my bikini line.
'He told me that the spot on my groin had become infected, and I'd been very lucky to survive.'
Mrs Sedgewick was transferred to the hospital's burns unit for specialist treatment, and was able to see her legs for the first time.
Mrs Sedgewick, who has been left with extensive scarring, said: 'It didn't feel like my own body any more.
'It's incredible to think a tiny shaving spot could have killed me.

Police warn teenagers are being hospitalized after eating garden products for psychotic high
* Blue morning glory and hawaiian baby woodrose are sold in garden stores
* But police warn the natural products are being used by teens to get high
* They produce the same effects as LSD when drunk in tea or swallowed
* Teens in Massachusetts have been hospitalized after eating the seeds  By MIA DE GRAAF FOR DAILYMAIL.COM  PUBLISHED: 11:59 EST, 5 May 2016 | UPDATED: 13:04 EST, 5 May 2016
Flower seeds are the new party drug, police are warning.
Hawaiian Baby Woodrose, Sleepy Grass, and Blue Morning Glory are sold in garden stores to grow climbing vines, long grass, and flowers.
But there has been a surge teenagers across America crushing up and swallowing the legal products to replicate the effects of LSD.
This week, Massachusetts police issued a warning to parents after a number of teenagers were hospitalized with extreme psychotic reactions in Seekonk, near Providence, Rhode Island.
And now Home Depot stores in the area are pulling the seeds from shelves in a bid to curb the situation.
The seeds contain LSA (lysergic acid amide), a hallucinogen similar to LSD.
When swallowed whole or crushed into tea, they affect a person's sight, vision, and sense of time, often making them feel extreme euphoria and extreme fatigue.
Like LSD, it can also provoke psychotic episodes, flashbacks, overwhelming paranoia, and vomiting.
Seekonk Police Chief Craig Mace said investigators have found the seeds on high school and middle school campuses across the town.
It is hardly the first instance of people using natural products to induce a high, he warns.
'We as human beings have a tendency to come up with different ways to become impaired, or however you want to describe it,' Mace said in a statement on the department's Facebook page.
'Here we have a natural product that's intended for ornamental purposes, and somehow, someone figured out that it could cause a hallucinogenic effect,' he continued.
'Parents should know if their children are into planting flowers or not, so if they see these things in the household, the radar should be on, the red flag should go up.'
Though purchasing the seeds is legal, extracting the LSA is illegal.
Hawaiian Baby Woodrose is a yellow/light brown seed which grows in a furry pod.
Native to South America and Africa, the seeds can be planted to grow invasive but beautiful leafy vines.
The seeds' psychotic properties were first recorded in the 1960s.
Blue Morning Glory seeds are planted to grow delicate blue-and-white flowers.
The seeds are black.
Drug users crush them or lick them to induce a psychotic high.
Sleepy Grass seeds looks like pieces of buckwheat.
They grow long grass on dry soil, like that commonly seen across the plains of the Midwest and in the arid South West like Arizona.

The FDA is warning pasta and pizza lovers that cheese labeled ""100 percent Parmesan"" are often filled with cheese substitutes-like wood pulp.
Yes, you've been eating wood, thanks to companies like Castle Cheese, which produced Parmesan cheese containing no actual Parmesan for almost 30 years. The president of the company, which supplied megastores like Target, is scheduled to plead guilty this month to charges that carry a sentence of up to a year in prison and a $100,o00 fine, according to Bloomberg.
Neil Schuman-who runs Arthur Shcuman Inc. the largest seller of hard Italian cheese in the U.S.-estimates a whopping 20 percent of such cheese are mislabeled.
Bloomberg ran experiments on store-bought grated cheese to test for wood pulp content in a lab and found that many cheeses have cellulose, which is made from wood pulp. Essential Everyday 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese, from Jewel-Osco, contained 8.8 percent cellulose. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Great Value 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese had 7.8 percent cellulose. Whole Foods 365 brand didn't list cellulose as an ingredient, and tested at 0.3 percent. Kraft had 3.8 percent cellulose.

70,﻿snes-04570,"In June 2016, Michigan residents lost the ""right to farm,"" keep chickens, or maintain bee hives due to a change in existing law.","Michigan Loses 'Right To Farm' This Week: A Farewell To Backyard Chickens and Beekeepers
Michigan residents lost their ""right to farm"" this week thanks to a new ruling by the Michigan Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development.
Gail Philburn of the Michigan Sierra Club told Michigan Live, the news changes ""effectively remove Right to Farm Act protection for many urban and suburban backyard farmers raising small numbers of animals.""
Backyard and urban farming were previously protected by Michigan's Right to Farm Act. The Commission ruled that the Right to Farm Act protections no longer apply to many homeowners who keep small numbers of livestock.
The ruling will allow local governments to arbitrarily ban goats, chickens and beehives on any property where there are 13 homes within one eighth mile or a residence within 250 feet of the property, according to Michigan Public Radio.
The Right to Farm Act was created in 1981 to protect farmers from the complaints of people from the city who moved to the country and then attempted to make it more urban with anti-farming ordinances.
The new changes affect residents of rural Michigan too.
Shady Grove Farm in Gwinn, Michigan is the six and a half acre home to 150 egg-laying hens that provide eggs to a local co-op and a local restaurant.
The small Michigan farm also homes sheep for wool and a few turkeys and meat chickens to provide fresh healthy, local poultry.
""We produce food with integrity,"" Randy Buchler told The Blaze about Shady Grove Farm.
We take a lot of pride and care in what we're doing here."" Shady Grove Farm was doing its part to bring healthy, local, organic food to the tables of Gwinn residents, and it mirrors the attitudes of hundreds of other small farming operations in Michigan and thousands of others popping up around the nation.
""The Michigan Agriculture Commission passed up an opportunity to support one of the hottest trends in food in Michigan - public demand for access to more local, healthy, sustainable food,"" Gail Philbin told MLive.
""There's a lot of unnecessary legal action being taken against small farms who are doing good things in their communities,"" said Randy Buchler, who is also on the board of directors for the Michigan Small Farm Council.
The Michigan Small Farm Council  actively fought to support Michigan farming freedom, but ultimately the Commission voted to approve the new restrictions.
""Farm Bureau has become another special interest beholden to big business and out of touch with small farmers, and constitutional and property rights of the little guy,"" Pine Hallow Farms wrote to the Michigan Small Farm Council.
The Michigan Farm Bureau endorsed the new regulatory changes.
Matthew Kapp, government relations specialist with Michigan Farm Bureau, told MLive that the members weighed in and felt that people raising livestock need to conform to local zoning ordinances.

(NaturalNews) Ten brands of baby wipes produced by the Pennsylvania-based Nutek Disposables, Inc., were recalled on January 25, 2017, following complaints of foul odor and discoloration.
Upon further testing, the baby wipe and adult washcloth manufacturer discovered that some of their products contained Burkholderia cepacia, a species of antibiotic-resistant bacteria frequently found in soil and water, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Pulmonary infections involving these bacteria are capable of causing accelerated decline in lung functions and can induce ""cepacia syndrome,"" a progressive form of pneumonia that can be fatal and untreatable, according to MicrobeWiki.

Package insert for Fluzone flu vaccine marketed to seniors reveals 23 seniors died during drug trial
As you can see in the screen shot above, taken from the CVS website, senior citizens over the age of 65 are being targeted to get the ""high-dose"" flu vaccine.
The FAQ at the CVS website defines the ""high-dose"" flu vaccine: ""Containing four times the amount of antigen (the part of the vaccine that causes the body to produce antibody) in regular flu shots, high-dose flu shots, along with the additional antigen produced, are intended to create a stronger immune response.""
The name of this flu vaccine that is marketed for seniors is called ""Fluzone."" You can find it being marketed to seniors at all the major pharmacies in the United States.
Package inserts for flu vaccines show a multitude of side effects, including death, and yet they are marketed the same as over-the-counter drugs with no prescription needed.
With legal immunity to market dangerous products, don't expect those doing the marketing and making the profits to warn you of the side effects.
The high-dose Fluzone vaccine being marketed this flu season to seniors, which has four times the amount of antigens that the regular flu shot has, as well as the non-high dose version, had 23 seniors die during drug trials.
The package insert for the high-dose Fluzone flu vaccine is found here (for now).
A total of 23 deaths were reported during the period Day 29-180 post-vaccination: (0.6%) among Fluzone High-Dose recipients and 7 (0.6%) among Fluzone 1 recipients.
This statement stating that 23 seniors died, which really should be headline news but is buried in a package insert on the FDA website, begs several questions:
Shouldn't the deaths, if not attributable to the vaccine but pre-existing conditions, be equally spread out through all time periods?
The range of symptoms given in the package insert can very well cover almost all seniors during the flu season.
One of these other adverse side effects (besides death) is Guillain-Barré syndrome, which has symptoms similar to polio.
If you are brought into an emergency room with the paralyzing effects of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), the first question the doctors will ask you is if you just received the flu shot.
Also, if you look at the majority of damages being paid out to those damaged from vaccines in the U.S. Vaccine Court, Guillain-Barré syndrome from the flu vaccine is #1, and almost equals all other awards for damages combined.
(See: Flu Shot Causes Polio-like Guillain-Barré Syndrome: Are Rates Higher Than the Government Admits?)
But if that is the case, why is there a warning on package inserts of flu vaccines, and why is it the first question EMTs ask when dealing with GBS emergencies?
The package insert for Fluzone states: ""If Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has occurred within 6 weeks of previous influenza vaccination, the decision to give Fluzone High-Dose should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks.""
I wonder how many vaccine sales people at these pharmacies give ""careful consideration"" to this adverse side effect, or any others, before injecting you?","distinctive linguistic features </s> title of article as clickbait </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> financial motivation </s> financial motivation </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> lack of citation for evidence </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> financial motivation </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> wrong cause-effect </s> narrative with details </s> narrative with details_details not verified </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> bolded, underline or italicized </s> distinctive linguistic features",False,"23 Seniors Died After Receiving Flu Shots </s></s> Package insert for Fluzone flu vaccine marketed to seniors reveals 23 seniors died during drug trial

74,﻿tron-02234,Aborted Babies and Other Medical Waste Used for Fuel by Oregon,"Aborted fetuses from British Columbia incinerated in Oregon plant to make electricity
By Cheryl K. Chumley - The Washington Times - Thursday, April 24, 2014
The British Columbia Health Ministry recently admitted that tissues from aborted fetuses are part of the “biomedical waste” that it regularly sends to an American plant that turns the waste into electricity for Oregon-area residents.
Unnamed officials with the agency’s communications unit sent an email to B.C. Catholic admitting that “biomedical waste [which includes] human tissue, such as surgically removed cancerous tissue, amputated limbs and fetal tissue [is] disposed of through appropriate contacted providers,” The Blaze reported.
“Some is transferred to Oregon [where it’s] incinerated in a waste-to-energy plant,” the email continued. The agency also assured that the tissues and wastes are processed and handled in line with “health and safety protocols, as well as federal, provincial and local regulations.”
LifeSiteNews.com reported that the executive director of the Oregon Refuse and Recyling Association said to B.C. Catholic that the waste is likely deposited at the Covanta Marion plant — and the plant, meanwhile, confirmed it still receives and incinerates waste that comes from the medical community.
“Pontius Pilate would be proud,” United for Life President John Hof said to the B.C. Catholic. “This points to a ludicrous disconnect in our society.”

76,﻿snes-03067,Warren Buffett proposed a constitutional amendment that seeks to require laws apply equally to U.S. citizens and members of Congress.,"Warren Buffett is asking everyone to forward this email to a minimum of 20 people, and to ask each of those to do likewise.
In three days, most people in the United States will have the message.
This is an idea that should be passed around.
For too long we have been too complacent about the workings of Congress.
Many citizens had no idea that Congressmembers could retire with the same pay after only one term, that they didn't pay into Social Security, that they specifically exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed (such as being exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment) while ordinary citizens must live under those laws.
The latest is to exempt themselves from the Healthcare Reform that is being considered - in all of its forms.
We do not have an elite that is above the law.
I truly don't care if they are Democrat, Republican, Independent or whatever.
The self-serving must stop.
It is an idea whose time has come.
Proposed 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution:
Each person contact a minimum of Twenty people on their Address list, in turn ask each of those to do likewise.
Then in three days, all people in The United States of America will have the Message.
This is one proposal that really should be passed around.
This is a great idea.
Only need 3/4 of the State Legislatures to pass this to become law...

83,﻿abbc-00201,"Animal rights group PETA says vegetarians and vegans weigh less than meat eaters and have a reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes and strokes","Source:
The less animal products someone consumes, the lower his body mass index on average and the less he tends to be extroverted.
A large-scale study at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (MPI CBS) in cooperation with the University Hospital of Leipzig has now examined in almost 9,000 people how this form of nutrition is related to the body and the psyche -- regardless of age, gender and level of education.
It was found that the rarer the proportion of animal food in a person's diet, the lower their body mass index (BMI) on average and thus their body weight.
One reason for this could be the lower proportion of heavily processed foods in the plant diet.
If you avoid animal foods, you consume fewer such products on average,"" explains Evelyn Medawar, first author of the underlying publication, which has now been published in the journal Nutrients.
For the BMI it also seems to make a difference which animal products a person feeds on.
If it is predominantly so-called primary animal products, i.e. meat, sausage and fish, the person usually has a higher BMI than someone who eats primarily secondary animal products, i.e. eggs, milk, dairy products, cheese and butter.
Medawar uses an example to illustrate what this could mean for nutrition: ""A person with a 1.2 point lower BMI on average either completely avoids certain animal products, such as the primary ones, and is on a vegetarian diet.
Whether nutrition is ultimately the cause of lower body weight or whether other factors are responsible for it cannot be determined from the data.
The researchers also found out that vegetarian or vegan nutrition is also related to personality.
It was shown that people with predominantly plant-based foods on their diet are more introverted than those who mainly fed on animal products.
However, they could not confirm that a plant-based diet is associated with a tendency towards neurotic behaviour, as other studies suggested.
""Earlier analyses had found that more neurotic people were generally more likely to avoid certain groups of foods and to behave more restrictively.
We focused here solely on the avoidance of animal products and could not observe any correlation,"" explains study leader Veronica Witte.
In a third part, they finally concentrated on the question of whether a predominantly plant-based diet is more often associated with depressive moods.
""It is possible that in previous analyses other factors had blurred the results, including the BMI or conspicuous personality traits that are known to be associated with depression.
We accounted for them,"" said Witte explaining a possible reason for the different results.
In addition, the plant-based diet is now more common and more accepted and not anymore restricted to a certain group.
The scientists had investigated these connections within the so-called LIFE project, a broad-based study in cooperation with the University Hospital of Leipzig.

A large-scale study at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (MPI CBS) in cooperation with the University Hospital of Leipzig has now examined in almost 9,000 people how this form of nutrition is related to the body and the psyche -- regardless of age, gender and level of education.
It was found that the rarer the proportion of animal food in a person's diet, the lower their body mass index (BMI) on average and thus their body weight.
One reason for this could be the lower proportion of heavily processed foods in the plant diet.
If you avoid animal foods, you consume fewer such products on average,"" explains Evelyn Medawar, first author of the underlying publication, which has now been published in the journal Nutrients.
If it is predominantly so-called primary animal products, i.e. meat, sausage and fish, the person usually has a higher BMI than someone who eats primarily secondary animal products, i.e. eggs, milk, dairy products, cheese and butter.
Medawar uses an example to illustrate what this could mean for nutrition: ""A person with a 1.2 point lower BMI on average either completely avoids certain animal products, such as the primary ones, and is on a vegetarian diet.
It was shown that people with predominantly plant-based foods on their diet are more introverted than those who mainly fed on animal products.
However, they could not confirm that a plant-based diet is associated with a tendency towards neurotic behaviour, as other studies suggested.
""Earlier analyses had found that more neurotic people were generally more likely to avoid certain groups of foods and to behave more restrictively.
We focused here solely on the avoidance of animal products and could not observe any correlation,"" explains study leader Veronica Witte.
In a third part, they finally concentrated on the question of whether a predominantly plant-based diet is more often associated with depressive moods.
""It is possible that in previous analyses other factors had blurred the results, including the BMI or conspicuous personality traits that are known to be associated with depression.
In addition, the plant-based diet is now more common and more accepted and not anymore restricted to a certain group.

The deal also includes an exchange of debt.
The purchase values Smithfield Foods at $7.1 billion - a figure that would make the purchase ""the largest Chinese takeover of a U.S. company,"" according to Bloomberg News.
In addition to Smithfield, the company's brands include Armour, Eckrich, Gwaltney, Kretschmar, and others.
The company's roots stretch back to 1936, when the Luter family opened a packing plant in Virginia.
Terms of the purchase value Smithfield's stock at $34 a share - a premium of more than 30 percent over the company's closing share price yesterday.
The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the sale, says the company's shares rose sharply before the markets opened Wednesday.
The deal will require approval from U.S. regulators before it is final.
""This is a great transaction for all Smithfield stakeholders, as well as for American farmers and U.S. agriculture,"" Smithfield president and CEO Larry Pope said.
""We have established Smithfield as the world's leading and most trusted vertically integrated pork processor and hog producer, and are excited that Shuanghui recognizes our best-in-class operations, our outstanding food safety practices and our 46,000 hard-working and dedicated employees.""
Shuanghui International is the majority owner of Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development Co.

""China is the world's biggest producer and consumer of pork and the third-largest market for U.S. pork,"" Reuters reports.
""In recent months, a series of food safety scandals have dented consumer confidence.""
Smithfield's headquarters will remain in Virginia, according to a press release announcing the deal this morning.
The companies also said that Shuangui will not close any Smithfield facilities, and will leave all employee agreements - and the existing management team - in place.
The purchase would further solidify an economic relationship between China and Virginia that has been growing.
The state has sent several trade missions to Asia in recent years, helping China become what Gov. Bob McDonnell calls ""far and away our largest trading partner,"" as member station WAMU recently reported.
McDonnell made that comment earlier this month, when he announced Virginia's $638 million of agricultural exports to China in 2012.

""China is the world's biggest producer and consumer of pork and the third-largest market for U.S. pork,"" Reuters reports.

Smithfield's headquarters will remain in Virginia, according to a press release announcing the deal this morning.
The companies also said that Shuangui will not close any Smithfield facilities, and will leave all employee agreements - and the existing management team - in place.
The purchase would further solidify an economic relationship between China and Virginia that has been growing.
The state has sent several trade missions to Asia in recent years, helping China become what Gov. Bob McDonnell calls ""far and away our largest trading partner,"" as member station WAMU recently reported.
McDonnell made that comment earlier this month, when he announced Virginia's $638 million of agricultural exports to China in 2012.

I'm writing this to let you know our experience with homemade slime.
If you have elementary age kids, you are probably familiar with the current slime obsession.
My daughter and her friends became obsessed with it a few months ago and couldn't get enough of it.
So much so that they decided they would start making it themselves at home, a simple endeavor providing you have the right ingredients.
Basically, homemade slime consists of:
White Glue
You might have also heard how stores can't even keep enough glue in stock.
There are variations of the above for sure, but these ingredients are what my daughter and her friends were using to create their slime.
They have never had more than your basic cold that lasted a few days.
When my 12 year old got sick, we thought it was the same basic cold.
Symptoms were the same: cough, sore throat, stuffy nose.
She was also complaining about headaches and general achiness.
Assuming her symptoms would be relieved in a few days, we didn't pay them much mind.
To the doctor we went.
Other than your basic cold symptoms, there wasn't anything wrong with her on the surface.
You know how as a parent you just kind of the get the feeling that there is more to something than meets the eye?
He told me one night, ""Do you think it could have something to do with the slime she's been making?""
It was like a lightbulb went off.
From that moment, we banned her from making, holding, touching or even looking at that darn slime.
The very next day, her headache went away.
Two days later, the congestion started going away.
Could the homemade slime have been poisoning my daughter?
Then this article started to make it around on some of my friends' Facebook feeds: Schoolyard Slime Craze Risk to Children Says Experts.
BORAX - FROM THE WEBSITE, CQ CONCEPTS:
These substances are toxic to all cells, and have a slow excretion rate through the kidneys.
Kidney toxicity is the greatest, with liver fatty degeneration, cerebral edema, and gastroenteritis.
Boric acid solutions used as an eye wash or on abraded skin are known to be especially toxic to infants, especially after repeated use due to its slow elimination rate.
GLUE - FROM THE WEBSITE, MEDILINE PLUS:
Symptoms of breathing in (""sniffing"") glue fumes may include:
* Low oxygen level in the blood and organs (respiratory failure)
SHAVING CREAM - FROM THE WEBSITE, HOW STUFF WORKS:
It's also a very controversial ingredient in the cosmetic industry because not only is it a skin irritant, but many formulas containing TEA are found to be contaminated with nitrosamines, which are linked to cancer.
Sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulphate (SLES) are two more controversial skincare ingredients.

93,﻿snes-05888,The consumption of poppy seeds used on bagels and muffins can produce positive results on drug screening tests.,"Can Eating Poppy Seeds Give You a Positive Drug Test?
Eating poppy seeds before a drug test could give you a positive result, and you don't need to eat that many for it to happen.
Even bagels, cakes, or muffins sprinkled with poppy seeds can cause a positive urine drug test, according to various case studies and other research.
Why do poppy seeds affect a drug screen?
Though poppy seeds go through a thorough cleaning before being processed for consumer use for baking and cooking, they may still contain trace amounts of opiate residue.
In the United States, up to 90 percent of the morphine content in opiate residue is removed from poppy seeds during processing.
The concentration of residue left on poppy seeds varies among countries.
How soon are opiates detected after eating poppy seeds?
Studies show that opiates can be detected as soon as two hours after eating a poppy seed cake or poppy seed bagels.
The amount of poppy seeds consumed appears to have something to do with it.
According to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, codeine and morphine remain detectable in urine up to 48 hours after eating poppy seeds.
How many poppy seeds is too many?
How many poppy seeds you need to consume for a positive drug test depends on a couple of things: the concentration of opiate residue on the poppy seeds and cutoff threshold used by the laboratory that's handling the results.
The amount of morphine or codeine in urine that's considered a positive result can vary from lab to lab.
The more poppy seeds you consume, the higher the chances of testing positive.
And the more poppy seeds you eat, the higher the amount of opiates in your sample.
Pastries containing poppy seeds aren't the only products of concern.
Unlike poppy seeds for baking and cooking that are regulated and go through a rigorous wash during processing, these products aren't regulated.
These products have led to overdoses and fatalities, including the death of two young men who died from overdosing on poppy seed tea.
Poppy seeds can be found in a number of baked goods and other foods.
Poppy seeds are easier to spot in some food products than others, so it's important to check the ingredients list first if you're concerned.

Feb 26, 2007
Product testing by several states has now confirmed that Peter Pan peanut butter and certain Great Value brand peanut butter are the sources of the foodborne illness outbreak of Salmonella Tennessee that began in Aug. 2006. To date 329 individuals have become ill from consuming the contaminated peanut butter, and 51 of those persons were hospitalized.
The outbreak is ongoing. All products containing Peter Pan brand peanut butter and all jars of Great Value brand peanut butter bearing a product code that begins 2111 are potentially contaminated. Potentially contaminated products include 3/4-oz. and 1.1-oz single serving packs of Peter Pan brand peanut butter. All of these products contain peanut butter that was manufactured in ConAgras Sylvester, GA plant. Retailers and institutions possessing the products described should not serve or sell them. Any consumer possessing any of these products should discard them.
Symptoms of foodborne illness caused by Salmonella include fever, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. In persons with poor underlying health or weakened immune systems, salmonella can invade the bloodstream and cause life-threatening infections. Individuals who have recently eaten any products containing Peter Pan peanut butter or Great Value brand peanut butter from a jar bearing a product code beginning 2111 and who have experienced any of these symptoms should contact their doctor or health care provider immediately and report the illnesses to their state or local health authorities. Similarly, institutional food establishments and other food service providers who have received reports of illness from consumers after they consumed one of these products are encouraged to share that information with their local health department.
ConAgra has recalled these products from stores and ceased production in their Sylvester, GA processing plant until the exact cause of contamination can be identified and eliminated. FDA is continuing to work closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and with states and local officials to identify how the contamination occurred in order to prevent similar foodborne illness outbreaks.

97,﻿snes-02739,"The FDA has updated its warnings for and recommended limitations on prescribing a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones, citing potentially irreversible side-effects including tendon damage and rupture","A new study suggests that the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) warnings about adverse events linked to fluoroquinolone antibiotics may have helped lower prescribing of the drugs, but not all physicians have been responsive to those warnings.
The study, published this week in JAMA Network Open, looked at data on more than 1.2 million Medicare patients who received fluoroquinolones and found that overall fluoroquinolone prescribing started declining significantly in the 31 months before the FDA issued a warning on fluoroquinolones in 2013.
Declines in fluoroquinolone prescribing after the warnings were observed only among certain types of physicians.
But over the last several years, the FDA has issued several warnings in response to adverse events that have been linked to fluoroquinolone treatment.
In 2016, the FDA revised the black box warning to further address these adverse events, recommending that patients with acute sinusitis, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) use fluoroquinolones only if no other treatment options are available.
Using an interrupted time series analysis, the researchers compared fluoroquinolone prescribing levels and trends during the 31 months prior to the 2013 warning (the baseline period), all months following the 2013 FDA warning (post-warning period 1), and all months following the 2016 warning (post-warning period 2).
The analysis found a significant decline in fluoroquinolone prescribing before the 2013 warning, with the trend declining by 0.18 percentage points per month (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.19 to -0.18; P < .001) during the baseline period.
The study authors suggest this could be linked to the 2008 FDA warning, which may have alerted physicians to be more cautious in their use of fluoroquinolones.
The immediate prescribing levels of fluoroquinolones in post-warning period 1 increased by 3.42 percentage points (95% CI, 3.23 to 3.62; P < .001) and declined by 0.77 percentage points (95% CI, -1.00 to -0.54; P < .001) in post-warning period 2.
Compared with the baseline period, the trend in fluoroquinolone prescribing increased by 0.08 percentage points per month (95% CI, 0.08 to 0.10; P < .001) in post-warning period 1 and 0.06 percentage points per month (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.08; P < .001) in post-warning period 2.
Physicians at teaching hospitals were the only ones who showed a decline in prescribing trend in post-warning period 1.
""Despite repeated warnings, some physicians were not responsive to the recommendations,"" the study authors wrote.
""Although PCPs showed a general decline in prescribing trends compared with non-PCPs, they did not demonstrate a differential change in behavior after the warnings, perhaps because many PCPs wrongly believed that fluoroquinolones were more appropriate for dealing with uncomplicated UTI symptoms than the recommended first-line therapies for this condition.""
The authors point out that the observed decline in fluoroquinolone prescribing could also reflect antibiotic stewardship measures that have specifically targeted inappropriate fluoroquinolone prescribing.

100,﻿tron-02253,General Electric is Moving X-Ray Division to China,"GE X-ray leaders move to China
General Electric Co.'s health care unit, the world's biggest maker of medical imaging machines, is moving the headquarters of its 115-year-old X-ray business to Beijing. ""A handful'' of top managers will move to the Chinese capital and there won't be any job cuts, said Anne LeGrand, general manager of X-ray for GE Healthcare. The headquarters will move from Wisconsin amid a broader plan to invest about $2 billion across China, including opening six ""customer innovation'' and development centers.
The division should have ""double-digit'' growth rates as the country converts from film and analog to digital X-ray technology, LeGrand said.
GE Healthcare, also the world's biggest maker of magnetic resonance imaging and cardiac tomography scanners, got about $1.1 billion of its $16.9 billion in sales from China last year.
The X-ray business, whose financial results aren't reported separately by GE, will hire 65 new engineers and support staff at a new Chengdu facility, the company said. GE has hired ""a large number'' of engineers who are in training, LeGrand said. GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., also has a global research center in Shanghai.
""Over the next five years, China will be GE Healthcare's most important growth market,'' said Rachel Duan, the China unit's chief executive.

101,﻿tron-02246,Cancer Update from Johns Hopkins,"1. Every person has cancer cells in the body.
When doctors tell cancer patients that there are no more cancer cells in their bodies after treatment, it just means the tests are unable to detect the cancer cells because they have not reached the detectable size.
3. When the person's immune system is strong the cancer cells will be destroyed and prevented from multiplying and forming tumors.
5. To overcome the multiple nutritional deficiencies, changing diet and including supplements will strengthen the immune system.
6. Chemotherapy involves poisoning the rapidly-growing cancer cells and also destroys rapidly-growing healthy cells in the bone marrow, gastro-intestinal tract etc, and can cause organ damage, like liver, kidneys, heart, lungs etc.
7. Radiation while destroying cancer cells also burns, scars and damages healthy cells, tissues and organs.
9. When the body has too much toxic burden from chemotherapy and radiation the immune system is either compromised or destroyed, hence the person can succumb to various kinds of infections and complications.
Chemotherapy and radiation can cause cancer cells to mutate and become resistant and difficult to destroy.
Surgery can also cause cancer cells to spread to other sites.
An effective way to battle cancer is to starve the cancer cells by not feeding it with the foods it needs to multiply.
CANCER CELLS FEED ON:
By cutting off sugar it cuts off one important food supply to the cancer cells.
b. Milk causes the body to produce mucus, especially in the gastro-intestinal tract.
By cutting off milk and substituting with unsweetened soya milk cancer cells are being starved.
c. Cancer cells thrive in an acid environment.
A meat-based diet is acidic and it is best to eat fish, and a little chicken rather than beef or pork.
d. A diet made of 80% fresh vegetables and juice, whole grains, seeds, nuts and a little fruits help put the body into an alkaline environment.
Fresh vegetable juices provide live enzymes that are easily absorbed and reach down to cellular levels within 15 minutes to nourish and enhance growth of healthy cells.
To obtain live enzymes for building healthy cells try and drink fresh vegetable juice (most vegetables including bean sprouts) and eat some raw vegetables 2 or 3 times a day.
Green tea is a better alternative and has cancer-fighting properties.
Cancer cell walls have a tough protein covering.
By refraining from or eating less meat it frees more enzymes to attack the protein walls of cancer cells and allows the body's killer cells to destroy the cancer cells.
Some supplements build up the immune system (IP6, Flor-ssence, Essiac, anti-oxidants, vitamins, minerals, EFAs etc.) to enable the body's own killer cells to destroy cancer cells.
Other supplements like vitamin E are known to cause apoptosis, or programmed cell death, the body's normal method of disposing of damaged, unwanted, or unneeded cells.
Cancer is a disease of the mind, body, and spirit.
Anger, unforgiveness and bitterness put the body into a stressful and acidic environment.
Cancer cells cannot thrive in an oxygenated environment.

102,﻿snes-02381,Does 'Paint Thinner' Trisodium Phosphate Lurk in Cereals?,"Trisodium Phosphate in Cereal: Could You Be Eating Paint Thinner for Breakfast?
And lately, we've been wanting to get to the bottom of a rumor circulating the deep, dark depths of the internet: That trisodium phosphate in cereal is also the primary ingredient in paint thinner.
But if you want the cold, hard facts on trisodium phosphate in cereal, you'll find conflicting information across the world wide web.
The USDA classifies trisodium phosphate as ""generally recognized as safe"" (GRAS), allowing its use in baked goods, breads, meats, and cheese.
Trisodium phosphate is just one of several other phosphate additives the food industry uses, including tripolyphosphate, tripotassium phosphate, hexametaphosphate, acid pyrophosphate, and orthophosphates.
The USDA states that trisodium phosphate is generally safe, but that's not always the best measurement of health.
A Washington Post article, which noted the use of phosphates in packaged meats, quoted experts who said that phosphates are connected to many health risks, including early death.
In recent years, health blogs have slammed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for allowing the use of trisodium phosphate in cereal.
In fact, a Change.Org petition garnered more than 1,350 signatures calling for big brands, namely General Mills, to remove the use of trisodium phosphate in popular cereals including Cheerios, Golden Grahams, Lucky Charms, and Honey Comb.
The petition describes trisodium phosphate as a chemical that is ""dangerous and is not healthy for a human to consume."" It also states that the ingredient is ""used in paint thinners and cleaning products."" And while it acknowledges the FDA's claim that the ingredient is safe, it offers a counter-argument saying, ""Why have it at all?
Various ""debunking"" sites state that trisodium phosphate is safe to consume because the amounts used in foods are far less than the high levels of phosphates used in cleaners and industrial products.
For example, consuming one gram of trisodium phosphate could cause health problems, including diarrhea and abdominal pain.
However, the amounts used in food-grade trisodium phosphate, like breakfast cereal, are far less.
In 2015, General Mills fired back at a series of tweets from consumers angered about the use of trisodium phosphate in their cereal.
The brand assured buyers that trisodium phosphate was ""just salt"" that adjusts the acidic nature of food, and adjusts the cereal color.
The company also brought up the FDA, noting that the federal organization marked the product as safe to use in a number of foods.
Should You Be Worried About Trisodium Phosphate in Cereal?
Trisodium phosphate is a food additive used in packaged baked goods and meat products.
This chemical is used in industrial products, such as bleach and paint thinner.
However, the USDA has marked trisodium phosphate as generally safe, and you would need to ingest large amounts of it (far more than you'll find in your morning bowl of Lucky Charms) for it to pose a serious health risk.
At Cereal School, we believe there's no need for trisodium phosphate in food.

The USDA classifies trisodium phosphate as ""generally recognized as safe"" (GRAS), allowing its use in baked goods, breads, meats, and cheese.
In recent years, health blogs have slammed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for allowing the use of trisodium phosphate in cereal.
In fact, a Change.Org petition garnered more than 1,350 signatures calling for big brands, namely General Mills, to remove the use of trisodium phosphate in popular cereals including Cheerios, Golden Grahams, Lucky Charms, and Honey Comb.
The petition describes trisodium phosphate as a chemical that is ""dangerous and is not healthy for a human to consume."" It also states that the ingredient is ""used in paint thinners and cleaning products."" And while it acknowledges the FDA's claim that the ingredient is safe, it offers a counter-argument saying, ""Why have it at all?
Various ""debunking"" sites state that trisodium phosphate is safe to consume because the amounts used in foods are far less than the high levels of phosphates used in cleaners and industrial products.
Trisodium phosphate is a food additive used in packaged baked goods and meat products.
However, the USDA has marked trisodium phosphate as generally safe, and you would need to ingest large amounts of it (far more than you'll find in your morning bowl of Lucky Charms) for it to pose a serious health risk.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) on Sunday refused to say if some women would lose access to birth control benefits after Republicans repeal President Barack Obama's health care reform law.
The Wisconsin Republican promised during an interview on CNN that the repeal of Obamacare would lower the costs of health care by providing ""vouchers"" to poor Americans.
CNN host Jake Tapper noted that many women were paying nothing for birth control thanks to an Affordable Care Act mandate.
""Look, I'm not going to get into all the nitty-gritty details of these things,"" Ryan replied curly.
""I'm not a preacher, nor am I a holy man, but the fact to the matter is that Obamacare is bad for our economy, it's bad for Americans, both poor ones and ones who aren't, overall, it's a bad program and a bad piece of legislation and that's why it's gotta go,"" Ryan argued stubbornly, all the while ignoring the question.
""And if our biology allowed for a safe way to have intercourse, if we were meant to have intercourse completely naturally and not get pregnant because of it, then God would have included something about it in one of his Holy Books.
Now, I haven't found anything on the subject - and not for lack of looking, Jake - have you, perhaps?""
""We're going completely off topic here,"" Tapper tried to get the conversation back on track.
""Do you or do you not admit that,"" he attempted to form a sentence, when Ryan rudely interrupted him and said, ""Look Jake, I respect everything you're trying to do here, I get you're a big-shot reporter, anchor or whatever they call you people these days, it doesn't even matter.
The fact to the matter is - we are in a situation here where the citizens of our country were led to believe that they actually had something to gain thanks to Obamacare.
Yet, it was never explained to them that all those benefits had to come from somewhere, and the former president never told them that they came from hard-working Americans whose taxes were raised to pay for the so-called free birth control.""
""Now, how would you feel, Jake, if someone were to take a huge chunk of your hard-earned money and use it to give something to someone you've never met?"" Ryan asked the host.
""And the worst part is - nobody asked Americans whether or not they agree to their taxes being raised to help people they don't know, that very fact goes against the essence of capitalism.
The other part of the reason why women shouldn't be allowed to use birth control at all is the fact that, in doing so, they're committing murder and that goes against everything this country stands for.""

The earth constantly offers the purest substance on the planet as spring water.
We celebrate this ancient life source that humanity flourished from, since the beginning of our existance.
<b>  Shocking but true <b> - All other filtered and even bottled spring waters are sterilized with UV light, ozone gas, and a sub micron filter.
This is similar to how most juice and dairy products are pasteurized for shelf stability.<b> Unfortunately this sterilization destroys beneficial sources of minerals and probiotics.
<b> Microbes outnumber human cells in the body 10 fold.
<b> There are more nerve endings in our bellies than in our brains and there's a constant battle between good and bad bacteria.
The micro biome of our gut produces about 95% of the serotonin and 50% of the dopamine in our  brains.
<b> Anxiety, weight gain, fatigue, and countless other ailments are linked to an imbalance of proper gut bacteria.
<b> Living spring water is the key to unlocking a perfect micro-biome balance.
The probiotics listed here are exclusive to our unsterilized water.
There could be countless other benificial microbes present, scientists just haven't discovered yet.
Without these probiotics we're not able to fully assimilate all the nutrients in our food.
Beneficial bacteria are also ​proven​ to have abilities to transform harmful bacteria.
<b> Here is a published medical report proving raw spring water has vast healing abilities.
The Līve Water Revival is starting and it's upgrading personal and ecological health for the whole planet.

Kate Ogg has an answer ready for the day her son Jamie asks who's older, he or his twin sister:
""Technically, you're two minutes older,"" she'll tell him, ""but Emily's been alive longer.""
Shortly after Jamie and Emily were born prematurely at 27 weeks on March 25, 2010, doctors told Ogg and her husband David that Jamie had died.
Nurses placed his limp body across his mother's bare chest so she could say goodbye.
The baby's doctor told the Oggs his movements were reflexive and not a sign of life.
But as his mother continued cuddling him, Jamie opened his eyes.
Their tiny baby grew stronger and stronger in his mother's arms, and their final goodbye turned into a hello.
Born prematurely at 27 weeks, twins Emily and Jamie made a dramatic entrance.
Jamie was declared dead shortly after birth, but revived after cuddling skin-to-skin with his mother.TODAY / Today
""I'd carried him inside me for only six months - not long enough - but I wanted to meet him, and to hold him, and for him to know us,"" Kate Ogg told TODAY's Ann Curry in 2010.
""We feel so fortunate,"" David Ogg told TODAY.
The Oggs' experience garnered international media attention and dramatically highlighted the benefits of parents holding newborns skin-to-skin on their bare chests, which is commonly called ""kangaroo care."" Though the medical benefits of skin-to-skin contact are well documented, it's still not encouraged, or even allowed, at many hospitals.
Jamie and Emily, now nearly 2, are doing great, Kate Ogg said in a Skype interview as she and her husband held the tow-headed toddlers on their laps.
The twins' last checkups showed they are developing completely normally, she said.
Soon after the twins' premature birth - and Jamie's revival - the Oggs promised themselves they wouldn't drive themselves crazy worrying about potential problems related to their children's prematurity.
""If there was a problem,"" Kate Ogg says they figured, ""we'd find out about it eventually.""
Still, Ogg and her husband think about Jamie's brush with death ""all the time.
A Colorado woman told Ogg Jamie's story caused distress in a support group for parents who've lost babies.
""The portrayal of our story almost suggested if you love your baby enough you can bring it back to life.
As the spotlight faded, the Oggs returned to normal life as a happy family - and these days they have a new blessing to count.

Himalayan salt lamps are decorative lights you can buy for your home, which are merely light bulbs of varying wattages placed within blocks of rock salt of varying sizes, have become an increasingly popular product in the alternative medicine scene and are marketed as ""natural ionizers.""
According a popular (and representative) Facebook post about salt lamps, the product can positively affect your health in 7 ways:
* They emit ""boundless amounts"" of negative ions, which counter the positive ions that both surround us and make us feel bad.
* Those ions increase oxygen flow to the brain which combats lethargy, gives you more energy, and causes you to be more alert and responsive to your surroundings.
* The ions negate the ""radioactive waves"" or ""electric smog"" emitted by our electrical devices.
* The ions offer protection from airborne toxins that could be floating around us.
* The constant intake of negative ions makes your slumber less fitful, and helps you get more out of your rest.
* The ions lower high blood pressure, reducing the chance of heart attacks and strokes.
* The salt that is used in these lamps, Himalayan salt, contains up to 84 trace minerals that your body needs, allowing the lamp to also strengthen your bone, regulate your body pH, and balance the water content in your body.

110,﻿tron-02229,Baylor Fredrickson Needs Bone Marrow Match,"7-year-old Albany boy needs bone marrow match
By ABC7
ALBANY, Calif.
Seven-year-old Baylor Fredrickson is bi-racial, and while there are more than 10 million bone marrow donors in the national registry, only about 400,000 are mixed race.
And because donors ideally need to be ethnically similar, finding a life-saver is daunting.
Baylor, who is battling leukemia, loves math, Greek mythology and sports.
A video by the Asian American Donor Program is one of the ways the family is reaching out.
Baylor needs a bone marrow transplant and his sister Maddie is not a match.
Their parents are Japanese and German, so a mixed race donor -- Asian and Caucasian -- would be ideal, but so far a worldwide search has come up empty.
For more than two decades Asian American Donor Program spokesperson Jonathan Leong has tried to encourage more people to step up.
""The number one thing is, 'it doesn't pertain to me, I don't have a family member, I'm not affected,'"" Leong explained.
""It doesn't hit you until it hits close to home and that's the sad part.""
Rob Fredrickson is Baylor's dad.
His son endured chemotherapy two years ago that they thought had eradicated the leukemia.
Now only a bone marrow transplant will do.
And he says Baylor knows finding a donor is a challenge.
""He's spoken to us about the possibility that he may pass away,"" Rob said.
""He's well aware of his own situation.""
But at the same time the family is not giving up hope.
There's a concerted effort to increase the number of minority donors in the national registry.
San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and Olympic skater Kristi Yamaguchi are involved in public awareness campaigns.
""If it's not Baylor's life, it might be another patient,"" Rob Fredrickson said.

111,﻿tron-01832,Beware of potential pollution from certain candles,"(WebMD) - When Cathy Flanders, 41, of Plano, Texas, started burning candles for their pleasant smell in the spring of 1997, it never occurred to her she could be poisoning her family.
Three years, a serious illness and a lawsuit later, Flanders has a lesson to share with anyone buying scented candles: Watch out for metal wicks.
Lead emitted by this type of candle is a serious health hazard.
""Candles are fast becoming one of the most common unrecognized causes of poor indoor air quality,"" says Diane Walsh Astry, executive director of the Health House Project, an American Lung Association education project in St. Paul, Minnesota.
The Flanders' woes started when Cathy was shopping at a clothing store and spotted some candles whose labels promised to fill her house with the pleasant fragrances of ""winter"" and ""spring."" Within six months of burning the candles, she noticed soot damage around her house.
But Cathy didn't pinpoint the source of the problem until after Ron Bailey of Bailey Engineering in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, analyzed the Flanders' candles and discovered lead emissions.
Around that time, 11-year-old Andrew Flanders' grades dropped precipitously.
When blood tests revealed an elevated level of lead, the Flanders promptly sent him to live with his aunt.
""The lead deposits in our home are such that we could not sell the house if we wanted to,"" says Flanders.
Testing revealed the lead level in the Flanders' home to be 40 milligrams per square foot - 27 times the limit allowed in Housing and Urban Development homes.
The Flanders aren't the only ones falling victim to pleasant-smelling candles with toxic wicks.
Ironically, the very candles sometimes used for aromatherapy can cause serious health problems.
The chief culprits are candles with wicks made with metal cores.
""Some candle makers use metal-core wicks because cotton wicks are often limp and fall over into the wax, extinguishing the flame,"" explains Jerome O.
Nriagu, Ph.D., a professor of environmental chemistry at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who has studied scented candles.
Cathy's husband, Kip, had his gall bladder removed because of an illness he blames on the candles.
Nriagu measured the lead released from 14 brands of candles.
He found that burning four metal-wick candles for two hours can result in airborne lead concentrations that pose a threat to human health.
After similar research in Australia, lead wicks in candles were banned there in September 1999.
But despite the urging of experts like Nriagu, the candles are still legal in the United States.
Not all candles - or even all scented candles - cause hazardous pollution.
But since labels won't tell which ones are safe, Astry and other candle experts offer this advice:
Watch out for shiny metal wire inside the wicks of candles.
Keep wicks trimmed to one-quarter inch for more complete combustion, and keep candles out of drafts.
Watch out for slow-burning candles with additives.

114,﻿snes-02554,Peanut butter can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's Disease.,"HERE'S HOW PEANUT BUTTER MAY ONE DAY HELP DIAGNOSE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Alzheimer's is a devastating degenerative disease that affects more than six million Americans.
Interestingly, a couple of studies were conducted in 2013 and 2015, that found an odor-detecting test using peanut butter might be a way to achieve early diagnosis.
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that slowly takes away a person's memory, ability to think, and eventually perform even the most basic tasks.
Alzheimer's (named after the physician who discovered it), is characterized by abnormal clumps and tangled bundles of proteins and fibers in the brain.
Another aspect of Alzheimer's is the loss of connection between nerve cells in the brain.
Now, we know that there are many complex brain changes that occur over time with this disease.
Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease.
Warning Signs For Alzheimer's Disease
There are several signs and symptoms that you or someone you love may have developed Alzheimer's disease.
The Peanut Butter Test
A 2013 study done by the University of Florida found that peanut butter might be helpful in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
Jennifer Camps, the lead on the small study, noticed that patients in the neurology lab she was working in were not tested on their sense of smell.
She and her colleagues developed a simple and inexpensive test using peanut butter and a ruler.
A clinician then opened a jar of peanut butter and held the ruler next to the patient's open nostril.
They then slowly moved the peanut butter one centimeter at a time while the patient was breathing out.
They continued this until the patient was able to smell the peanut butter.
They found that patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's had quite a difference in detecting the peanut butter between their left and right nostrils.
The left nostril required the peanut butter to be on average 10 centimeters closer in order to detect it than the right.
""But we plan to study patients with mild cognitive impairment to see if this test might be used to predict which patients are going to get Alzheimer's disease.""
Degenerative brain diseases like Alzheimer's are asymmetrical.
This means that by testing the capacity to smell in one nostril versus the other can predict the early onset of these diseases.
Though the results of the peanut butter test are certainly intriguing, many experts warn against jumping to conclusions.
""It would get you into that ballpark of Alzheimer's versus Lewy body disease, but it wouldn't help you distinguish between those two,"" said Mayo Clinic neurologist Dr. David Knopman.
For now, the University of Florida clinic uses the peanut butter test as a part of their diagnostics for detecting Alzheimer's disease.

115,﻿tron-01833,Dr. David Hager nominated for FDA panel,"Important - Women's Health Issue
Whether you're Right or Left on the issue of women's reproductive rights, please consider the following...
David Hager to head up the Food and Drug
Administration's (FDA) Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee.
This position does not require Congressional approval.
The FDA's Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee makes crucial decisions on matters relating to drugs used in the practice of obstetrics, gynecology and related specialties, including hormone therapy,
contraception, treatment for infertility, and medical alternatives to surgical procedures for sterilization
Dr. Hager's views of reproductive health care are far outside the mainstream and a setback for reproductive technology.
Dr. Hager is a practicing OB/GYN who describes himself as ""pro-life"" and refuses to prescribe contraceptives to unmarried women.
Hager is the author of ""As Jesus Cared for Women: Restoring Women Then and Now."" The book blends biblical accounts of Christ healing women with case studies from Hager's practice.
In the book Dr. Hager wrote with his wife, entitled ""Stress and the Woman's Body,"" he suggests that women who suffer from premenstrual syndrome should seek help from reading the bible and praying.
As an editor and contributing author of ""The Reproduction Revolution: A Christian Appraisal of Sexuality, Reproductive Technologies and the Family,"" Dr. Hager appears to have endorsed the medically inaccurate assertion that the common birth control pill is an abortifacient.
He has an ardent interest in revoking approval for mifepristone
(formerly known as RU-486) as a safe and early form of medical abortion.
Hagar recently assisted the Christian Medical Association in a ""citizen's petition"" which calls upon the FDA to revoke its approval of mifepristone in the name of women's health.
Hager's desire to overturn mifepristone's approval on religious grounds rather than scientific merit would
halt the development of mifepristone as a treatment for numerous medical conditions disproportionately

The Case for Cashews
Two handfuls of cashews each day may keep depression at bay. A growing body of research has found that in lieu of taking a prescription drug, some people can turn to foods that are high in tryptophans, like cashews. Depressive episodes are often triggered when the body drops in serotonin and tryptophans can boost it again, but people tend to turn to nutrition as a last resort. One more natural source of tryptophan is cashews. ""Several handfuls of cashews provide 1,000-2,000 milligrams of tryptophan, which will work as well as prescription antidepressants,"" says Dr. Andrew Saul, a therapeutic nutritionist and editor-in-chief of Orthomolecular Medicine News Service. The body turns tryptophan into serotonin, a major contributor to feelings of sexual desire, good mood, and healthy sleep.

The high levels of magnesium and vitamin B6 found in cashews may also help to stabilize mood. Approximately five ounces of cashews a day will provide a middle-aged man with his daily-required magnesium intake, a nutrient that, when low, can trigger mild depression. Vitamin B6 lends a hand to converting tryptophan into serotonin and helps magnesium enter into the body's cells. It's likely a trio of nutrients that help with depression. ""You don't want to think that one individual nutrient is the magic bullet,"" says Saul.

118,﻿snes-03188,Wheaties cereal sticks to magnets because it has metal flakes.,"Can Wheaties Really Stick To Magnets?
BY DEREK HELLING/JUNE 21, 2022 2:43 PM EDT
It's the Breakfast of Champions, but are Wheaties also a fun kids' science project that might make you question whether you want to actually eat the cereal, though? More specifically, do the flakes in Wheaties stick to magnets? General Mills has used sports figures to promote the iconic cereal but has not promoted the breakfast cereal as a way to play with magnets, although it does contain high amounts of a magnetically charged mineral: The cereal's nutrition facts say that one serving will supply you with 70% of your daily recommended allowance of iron.
Iron is necessary for a healthy diet, per Healthline, but imagine a cereal so laden with iron that it would actually stick to a magnet. Because Wheaties provide a lot of the essential nutrient, people have wondered if it's possible for magnets to pick up the cereal's flakes - some have even been curious enough about the phenomenon to try it out for themselves.
These opposites don't attract
So far, there is no documented evidence of magnets attracting Wheaties flakes like they would metal paperclips. My Recipes detailed one of the recent attempts to conduct this experiment and found that no matter how the magnets were positioned or how finely ground the flakes were, the magnets did not attract the cereal.
According to Daily Iron, every 100 grams of wheat boasts 3.8 milligrams of iron. While Wheaties lists wheat as its top ingredient, the amount of iron in each flake is still minuscule and apparently not enough to make the cereal magnetic. If that's a concern for you when choosing a breakfast cereal, fret not if you consider a box of Wheaties. While there are some cereals you should or shouldn't be eating, if you choose this one you aren't going to see any of the flakes sticking to a magnet in your home.

120,﻿tron-01791,Health Warnings About Flouroquinolone Antibiotics,"If you've not heard of the class of antibiotics called ""Fluoroquinolones,"" you want to.
After taking a round of Cipro in 2010, for a UTI, Amy Moser's life was forever changed and she's now writing in the hopes that someone, anyone, will read her story and be saved from the hell this class of drugs has wrecked on her body.
She writes that after taking that round in 2010 she experienced, ""Multiple spontaneous tendon and ligament ruptures, spinal degeneration, and arthritis that is widespread.
They go by many names, Cipro, Levaquin, Avalox, basically every generic ending in ""quin"", ""oxacin,"" or ""ox."" While the FDA has now updated their warning on these antibiotics (July 2016) siting, ""multiple system damage that may be irreversible,"" people are still taking them and though the info is there, no one is warning us.
So, as I always say, you MUST educate yourself:  https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm500143.htm.
Fluoroquinolones were intended to be a last resort type of drug when all other options failed.
The reason they were supposed to be a last resort is because of the severe damage they do to the body; they actually damage the DNA mitochondrial repair cells (the cells that heal any damage to the body).
So, if you take these drugs you are effectually damaging the very cells that are supposed to repair damaged cells and tissue.
""The more exposures you have to these antibiotics, the more damage is done to your body.
A hundred percent of people who take a Fluoroquinolone antibiotic, show changes in blood flow to the tendon, cartilage, and ligament in their bodies.
I fell apart after my 4th round of Fluoroquinolone antibiotics in my life and some people are on their 25th round and are still oblivious to what is happening inside them until they break.

121,﻿snes-01260,Exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke will get you high and potentially show up in a drug test.,"Secondhand Pot Smoke Can Make You Fail a Drug Test
People who are exposed to secondhand marijuana smoke may feel a bit of the ""high"" that comes with using the drug, a new study finds.
They may also feel unable to think clearly, and they may even have detectable levels of the drug in their urine or blood.
But all of this happens only if they are exposed to marijuana smoke under severely unventilated conditions, the study found.
""If you're going to breathe in enough passive cannabis smoke to feel high and potentially be slightly impaired, you could fail a drug test,"" said Evan S.
Studies in the 1980s showed that such ""social exposure"" to pot smoke could trigger positive drug tests for cannabis' main psychoactive ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
They used marijuana that had much lower potency than the pot available today and they failed to account for normal levels of ventilation in rooms.
""This new study probes a question people have been wondering forever,"" said Ziva Cooper, an assistant professor of clinical neurobiology at Columbia University, who was not involved in this research.
In the first study of its kind, Herrmann's team recruited about 20 healthy people between the ages of 18 and 45, including some who smoked marijuana and some who didn't use the drug.
The researchers tested the participants' blood, saliva, urine and hair samples for cannabis biomarkers, and then asked six smokers and six nonsmokers to relax in a Plexiglas and aluminum smoke chamber about the size of a dorm room.
The researchers gave each of the six smokers 10 marijuana cigarettes, each containing 1 gram of high-potency weed, and instructed them to smoke at their leisure for the hour while the six non-smokers sat by their side in the chamber.
During one test session, the room's ventilation system was switched on, allowing air to flow in and out at a standard office-building rate.
The new findings confirm ""it's really hard to get a positive [drug test result] from passive smoke unless you're in an extreme scenario,"" he said.
Under the unventilated, ""hot box"" condition, the nonsmokers showed slight impairments on cognitive tests, reported feeling high, and had detectable levels of THC in their blood and urine for up to 22 hours post-exposure.
Those in the ventilated condition had much lower levels of THC in their blood, did not feel impaired or high, and did not test positive for THC in their urine.
But the unventilated room is not representative of most real-life situations, the researchers said.
""You are in an enclosed room for an hour with 15 grams of cannabis being smoked.""
Ideally, the study would have had a placebo group, in which nonsmokers were exposed to smoke without THC.
This would have helped the researchers determine whether the feeling of being high was due to the marijuana or simply a placebo effect, from being exposed to smoke.
Still, ""this study is really important because it adds to our limited knowledge of the direct effects of cannabis smoking and the potential dangers of second-hand smoke,"" Cooper said.",citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> establishing legitimacy,True,"Exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke will get you high and potentially show up in a drug test. </s></s> People who are exposed to secondhand marijuana smoke may feel a bit of the ""high"" that comes with using the drug, a new study finds.

Under the unventilated, ""hot box"" condition, the nonsmokers showed slight impairments on cognitive tests, reported feeling high, and had detectable levels of THC in their blood and urine for up to 22 hours post-exposure.
Those in the ventilated condition had much lower levels of THC in their blood, did not feel impaired or high, and did not test positive for THC in their urine.
But the unventilated room is not representative of most real-life situations, the researchers said.
""You are in an enclosed room for an hour with 15 grams of cannabis being smoked.""
Ideally, the study would have had a placebo group, in which nonsmokers were exposed to smoke without THC.
This would have helped the researchers determine whether the feeling of being high was due to the marijuana or simply a placebo effect, from being exposed to smoke.
Still, ""this study is really important because it adds to our limited knowledge of the direct effects of cannabis smoking and the potential dangers of second-hand smoke,"" Cooper said. </s></s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> establishing legitimacy",Exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke will get you high and potentially show up in a drug test. </s></s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified,"Exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke will get you high and potentially show up in a drug test. </s></s> People who are exposed to secondhand marijuana smoke may feel a bit of the ""high"" that comes with using the drug, a new study finds.
But all of this happens only if they are exposed to marijuana smoke under severely unventilated conditions, the study found.
""If you're going to breathe in enough passive cannabis smoke to feel high and potentially be slightly impaired, you could fail a drug test,"" said Evan S.
Studies in the 1980s showed that such ""social exposure"" to pot smoke could trigger positive drug tests for cannabis' main psychoactive ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
They used marijuana that had much lower potency than the pot available today and they failed to account for normal levels of ventilation in rooms.
""This new study probes a question people have been wondering forever,"" said Ziva Cooper, an assistant professor of clinical neurobiology at Columbia University, who was not involved in this research.
In the first study of its kind, Herrmann's team recruited about 20 healthy people between the ages of 18 and 45, including some who smoked marijuana and some who didn't use the drug.
The researchers tested the participants' blood, saliva, urine and hair samples for cannabis biomarkers, and then asked six smokers and six nonsmokers to relax in a Plexiglas and aluminum smoke chamber about the size of a dorm room.
The researchers gave each of the six smokers 10 marijuana cigarettes, each containing 1 gram of high-potency weed, and instructed them to smoke at their leisure for the hour while the six non-smokers sat by their side in the chamber.

A Missouri mom is warning new parents to be vigilant after a strand of hair wrapped around her 5-month-old's toe acted as a tourniquet and cut off circulation for days.
Sara Ward, 33, told South West News Service that baby Logan could have lost the little piggy after the incident late last month.
Ward said she first noticed a line going across the middle toe of her son's right foot late one Saturday evening but ""didn't think much of it.""
The medic told them it was hair tourniquet syndrome: ""a rare clinical phenomenon that involves hair, thread, or similar material becoming so tightly wrapped around an appendage that it results in injury.""
Sara Ward shared this shocking photo of her son's toe after a strand of hair cut off circulation.

The strand of hair that was wrapped around Logan's toe was so thin that doctors were worried they could not remove it without surgery.
""They spent a good 40 minutes or so trying to get the hair and they had all these different tools that they were using - tweezers, magnifying goggles and special lights,"" Ward recalled.
""The toe was very painful for my son so he was crying and kicking and couldn't keep still as they were trying to get a better look at it.""
The rattled mom continued: ""They tried hair removal cream to try and break down the hair pieces and some numbing cream to get deeper with tweezers.""
Doctors decided to keep Logan in the hospital overnight to monitor the toe and make sure the hair had been properly removed and that his circulation was restored.
However, she and other perturbed parents are determined to raise awareness about the dangers of hair tourniquet syndrome, so other moms and dads don't have to go through the same drama.
""If the hair is embedded deeply into the appendage, and unable to be removed by the parents at home, please take baby to the hospital ASAP.
""A lot of people think 'It's just a piece of hair, how can you not see it and get it?' but it's really difficult with the swelling and the skin starts to kind of form over the hair,"" Ward explained.
""Now I'm always checking his toes and fingers now and making sure that I'm not seeing any hairs getting wrapped around them.
The incident took place just before the popular parenting page @tinyheartseducation warned of the syndrome on Instagram.
""While hair tourniquets are rare, they require quick recognition and treatment to prevent long-term damage to the body part,"" the account's owners wrote beneath a shocking social media post.
The post garnered thousands of likes, with multiple moms flocking to the comments section to claim their kids had been victims of hair tourniquet syndrome.

Jasper Hamill Tuesday 5 Dec 2017 5:25 pm
Cannabis is having a truly hideous effect on some unlucky stoners in the US, where it has recently been legalized in some states.
Doctors said users have been taken to hospital after suffering extreme bouts of 'scromiting' - which means they are screaming and vomiting at the same time.
This new word was invented by staff at emergency rooms across the US, who are seeing more and more people turn up yelling in pain and throwing up all over the place.
Its believed the scromiting is caused by a condition called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS) which affects people who have consumed weed for a long period of time.
The illness is not properly understood, but it's known that the only guaranteed way to stop it is for sufferers to give up smoking cannabis altogether.
Some people also get temporary relief by taking a hot bath.
Chalfonte LeNee Queen, a 47-year-old from San Diego, has experienced this grim condition.
She said the pain was sometimes so bad that she ended up on the floor, retching and wracked with pain.
'I've screamed out for death,' <a> she told NPR <a>.
'I've cried out for my mom, who's been dead for 20 years, mentally not realizing she can't come to me.'
The illness strikes users who have been smoking regularly for a long time, with one study suggesting people would need to <a> consume cannabis between three and fives time a day <a> to develop CHS.
'The syndrome was first described in 2004 by Allen and colleagues and is characterized by chronic cannabis use, cyclic episodes of nausea and vomiting, and the learned behaviour of hot bathing,' doctors wrote.

It's been suggested that CHS is caused by a build-up of cannabinoids in the body over a long period of time.
This may affect the function of cannabinoid receptors in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus which regulates the digestive system and body temperature.
The cannabis magazine High Times <a> gave the following description of the illness <a>: 'Often mistakenly called Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome, Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome is a rare form of cannabinoid toxicity that develops in chronic smokers.
'It's characterized by cyclic episodes of debilitating nausea and vomiting.

But many McDonald’s addicts have been forced to go cold turkey as numerous branches have yanked flagship burgers off the menu amid a tainted meat scandal.
The food scare broke when a video surfaced in Chinese media last week, showing appalling practices in a Shanghai food-processing factory that supplies ingredients to many international restaurant brands.
Since then, the tainted meat supply has been found to reach across China, all the way to Hong Kong, and even to Japan.
Food safety scare in China
A reporter from a Shanghai broadcaster secretly filmed inside the food processing plant of Shanghai Husi Food, a subsidiary of U.S.-based food supply giant OSI Group.
Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) subsequently investigated the factory and found that expired beef and chicken products were processed and repackaged with new expiration dates.
Husi had been supplying chicken and beef products to branches of McDonald’s, Papa John’s, Burger King, Starbucks, KFC, and Pizza Hut in several cities in China.
READ: China scare snares Burger King, Papa John’s
Since the scandal broke, all the brands have cut ties with Husi’s parent company OSI Group, except for McDonald’s.
The golden arches will continue to work with the food supplier in China, eventually shifting to a Husi food plant in Henan province, which was described as the “newest state-of-the-art facility” by OSI CEO Sheldon Lavin.
McDonald’s has worked with OSI for more than half a century internationally, and for more than 22 years in mainland China, a spokesperson surnamed Xu told CNN.
Meanwhile, beef and chicken products at most McDonald’s in northern and central China are unavailable.
Branches in southern China, which use a different meat supplier, are largely unaffected.
In Hong Kong, McDonald’s previously stated that it does not use products from Husi.
It later backtracked the claim after local government issued a ban on the import and sales of Husi products.
Japan’s McDonald’s have also been affected as 20% of the meat for chicken nuggets there were supplied by Husi.

Although no one has fallen sick as a direct result of the tainted meat supply, Shanghai’s FDA has closed the Husi plant at the center of the scandal, and detained five employees for questioning.
It has also announced a number of organizational changes that it says will better ensure food safety at its China subsidiaries.
It will also launch an Asia Quality Control Center in Shanghai and a three-year, RMB 10 million ($1.6 million) food safety campaign.

Food safety has long been a top concern for China, affecting domestic and foreign companies.
Yum Brands, the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut, has just emerged from a food safety scandal that began in late 2012.

The food scare broke when a video surfaced in Chinese media last week, showing appalling practices in a Shanghai food-processing factory that supplies ingredients to many international restaurant brands.
Since then, the tainted meat supply has been found to reach across China, all the way to Hong Kong, and even to Japan.
A reporter from a Shanghai broadcaster secretly filmed inside the food processing plant of Shanghai Husi Food, a subsidiary of U.S.-based food supply giant OSI Group.
Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) subsequently investigated the factory and found that expired beef and chicken products were processed and repackaged with new expiration dates.
Husi had been supplying chicken and beef products to branches of McDonald’s, Papa John’s, Burger King, Starbucks, KFC, and Pizza Hut in several cities in China.
Since the scandal broke, all the brands have cut ties with Husi’s parent company OSI Group, except for McDonald’s.
McDonald’s has worked with OSI for more than half a century internationally, and for more than 22 years in mainland China, a spokesperson surnamed Xu told CNN.
Meanwhile, beef and chicken products at most McDonald’s in northern and central China are unavailable.
In Hong Kong, McDonald’s previously stated that it does not use products from Husi.
Japan’s McDonald’s have also been affected as 20% of the meat for chicken nuggets there were supplied by Husi.

Although no one has fallen sick as a direct result of the tainted meat supply, Shanghai’s FDA has closed the Husi plant at the center of the scandal, and detained five employees for questioning.

A growing number of Americans are at risk for becoming allergic to red meat as ticks proliferate and spread across the country.
As much as 80 percent of people with meat allergies had also been bitten by a lone star tick, according to the first study to establish the connection.
Scientists have predicted that 2017 could be a very bad year for tick bites - and with them, meat allergies.
People with allergies to red meat often develop the reaction after being bitten by lone star ticks, which are becoming increasingly common in the US
People with red meat allergies may break out in a rash or hives, all sick to their stomachs, sneeze, develop asthma or a headaches, or even go into anaphylactic shock and stop breathing.
Alpha-gal is an antibody found in the cells of most mammals, but not in primates - including humans.
The ticks themselves aren't actually carry alpha-gal antibodies genetically, either.
Deer are one of a tick's favorite animals to feed off.
Like pigs and cattle, deer carry the alpha-gal antibodies.
When a tick latches on to a deer as an appetizer before moving on to bite a human, it carries leftover alpha-gal with it, sometimes transferring to the antibody it picked up from the deer to people.
Once a person has contracted alpha-gal, the body develops the allergic reaction to red meat, a misplaced immunological message that we are not supposed to eat it.
Only first identified in 2009, little is known about red meat allergies, including its exact prevalence.
Alpha-gal allergies mostly cause reactions to red meats, like beef, pork and venison, and occasionally to poultry.
It usually takes around four hours for an alpha-gal allergic reaction to set in after a person eats meat.

Red meat allergies are thought to be caused by lone star ticks, which live predominantly in the Eastern US, but are reportedly growing in number and spreading around the country 
Lone star ticks are found across a wide swath of the US, stretching from Maine at the country's Northeastern tip, westward and down to Texas's southern tail.
Back in May, scientists predicted a red-letter year for ticks in New Jersey and the Northeast.
[Image of Lonestar tick] 
Lone star ticks, so called for the white spot on their backs, are on the rise in the Northeastern US 
A combination of this year's unseasonably warm population and abundant mice populations (another favorite host for ticks) create perfect conditions for a variety of native ticks, including the lone star variety, to thrive.
Lone star ticks can transmit a number of bacterial diseases, viral infections and rashes, as well as the alpha-gal allergy, and are known to be 'aggressive' parasites.
Because people with red meat allergies are particularly prone to going into sudden and severe anaphylactic shock, it is advisable to carry an EpiPen.
Ticks typically live in forested areas with heavy ground cover, where they are hard to spot.

131,﻿snes-03690,"Doctors are now warning parents to never use baby wipes because they contain a ""chemical"" called methylisothiazolinone.","Doctor's Warning: Never Clean Your Child With Baby Wipes No Matter What
Many parents wouldn't think twice about what's in their child's baby wipes.
More and more research is surfacing that baby wipes aren't the best thing for our children's skin.
In fact, some doctors are recommending that parents cease using baby wipes on their children entirely, because of the risk they are taking each time they do so.
According to NBC News, a study has surfaced that confirms baby wipes are not safe to use on your children due to one key ingredient.
The results of the tests conducted were worrisome, as children ended up having a reaction that left them with itchy, scaly, and red-rashed looking skin.
She experimented with many different children, and in the end, six unique reactions caught her attention.
One eight-year-old girl ended up having a severe rash on her buttocks and also around her mouth.
Due to the location of where the reaction was located on the little girl's body, Dr. Chang narrowed the problem down to the baby wipes that were being provided to her.
She asked the little girl's mother what exactly she was providing her daughter to clean with, and the mother confirmed she gives her baby wipes.
Remembering a previous report Dr. Chang stumbled upon during her research, another case where a Belgian man had a severe chemical and allergic reaction to a chemical preservative called methylisothiazolinone - Dr. Chang linked this preservative to the exact baby wipe reaction as the little girl.
To be sure, Dr. Chang tested the little girl to see if she was officially allergic to this particular chemical, and sure enough, her test came back positive.
The solution was simple; the mother stopped using the baby wipes immediately, and all of the little girl's rashes successfully cleared up.
Over the next year and a half, Dr. Chang found similar reactions in five other kids.
Thanks to the successful conclusion of the first little girl, Dr. Chang had the five sets of parents cease using baby wipes on their children, and their rashes went away as well.
Now that this chemical is becoming a health and safety concern for children, they are reconsidering adding this ingredient to their products.
Another dermatologist, Dr. Ellen Frankel, also agrees with Dr. Chang that parents should not be using wipes on their children.
""I always tell parents do not under any circumstances use diaper wipes.
They have a lot of chemicals in there, and can irritate skin that's already damaged sitting in urine, or feces, or sitting in a diaper that's just got an inclusive surface on it.""
To make sure this harmful chemical is not going to cause the same problems for your child, look at the ingredients on the side of the baby wipe box.
If you see the chemical methylisothiazolinone, you may want to stop using those wipes and perhaps baby wipes altogether.

132,﻿tron-02217,ALS Association Supports Embryonic Stem Cell Research,"Catholics warned to mind ALS donations after flood of ice bucket challenges
Ice Bucket fundraiser raises concerns about embryonic stem-cell research in some dioceses.
Image caption: “Tara Villalobos of Richfield, Wis., dumped a bucket of ice water onto a participant of the fundraising challenge.”
The Newark, N.J., Roman Catholic Archdiocese has told pastors and Catholic school officials that holding Ice Bucket Challenges — the popular fad that has raised millions of dollars to combat a crippling illness ALS — conflicts with church teachings by funding embryonic stem-cell research.
The warning was issued in a letter from a church official and with the blessing of Archbishop John J.
It said some of the research funded by the ALS Association, which receives much of the money from the Ice Bucket Challenge, involves embryonic stem-cell research, which is opposed by the Catholic Church because of conflicts with its stance against abortion.
The challenge involves dumping ice water on participants’ heads and donating money for research into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.
Newark is one of just a few dioceses across the nation that have issued advisories about the Ice Bucket Challenge, which has become a social media sensation.
The archdiocese sent the letter Thursday to principals at all 94 Catholic schools in the archdiocese, and to pastors and religious education staff at 218 parishes.
It suggested sending donations to organizations that don’t use embryonic stem-cell research.
The ALS Association responded to the warnings with a statement saying it primarily funds adult stem-cell research, which is not opposed by the Catholic Church.
The statement went on to say that the association is funding one study that uses embryonic stem cells, and that research is funded by “one specific donor who is committed to this area of research.”
“In fact, donors may stipulate that their funds not be invested in this study or any stem-cell project,” the statement said.
Pastors were sent the letters for informational purposes, said archdiocesan spokesman Jim Goodness, but it’s up to them to decide how or whether they will share that information with parishioners.
Embryonic stem-cell research does not rank as a major issue for most Catholics.
In a 2009 Gallup survey, 63 percent of Catholics said embryonic stem-cell research was “morally acceptable.”
Last September, Pope Francis said church leaders had become too focused on social issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion and had strayed from their pastoral mission of helping the poor.
Goodness said the guidance regarding donations to ALS does not conflict with the pope’s message, and merely tells people to be aware of potential conflicts with Catholic teaching.
Raul Caceres, a Teaneck parishioner who has campaigned against lavish upgrades to Myers’ future retirement home, said the letter is an example of the archdiocese defying the wishes of Pope Francis.
Caceres, a surgeon, said he disagrees with church teaching on the issue of embryonic stem-cell research.

The Newark, N.J., Roman Catholic Archdiocese has told pastors and Catholic school officials that holding Ice Bucket Challenges — the popular fad that has raised millions of dollars to combat a crippling illness ALS — conflicts with church teachings by funding embryonic stem-cell research.
It said some of the research funded by the ALS Association, which receives much of the money from the Ice Bucket Challenge, involves embryonic stem-cell research, which is opposed by the Catholic Church because of conflicts with its stance against abortion.

133,﻿snes-01221,IKEA released a magazine ad which includes a pregnancy test.,"IKEA RELEASES AD THAT DOUBLES AS A PREGNANCY TEST AND REVEALS CRIB DISCOUNT 
Ikea’s newest advert has a rather odd request for women.
Created by Swedish agency Åkestam Holst, the new ad featured in Amelia magazine asks them to pee on the ad - and if they're pregnant a special discount code on cots will be revealed.
Doubling as a free pregnancy test, the new ad, which reads, “Peeing on this ad could change your life,” uses technology similar to those found in pregnancy-test kits - and it is quite ingenious.
The store says that a positive pregnancy reading will result in a discount of 50 per cent off.
According to the agency, getting the technological aspect of the ad took some work. However, “The pregnancy test strip was used as a starting point, which relies on antibodies that bind to the pregnancy hormone hCG, resulting in colour change.”
Additionally, “Careful selection of materials, together with a controlled capillary flow have been crucial for the success of this project.”
Since the ad has been released, people have taken to social media to discuss it - and a majority are impressed with the innovation.
Others found humour in the new advert - while some found the concept gross.
Some people raised questions about how Ikea employees would go about accepting a positive pregnancy advert - while others wondered why bringing in a positive pregnancy test wasn't good enough.
Either way, it is impossible to deny that this is pretty cool technology.
Regarding the new advert, Åkestam Holst's Art Director, Evelina Rönnung, told The Independent: ""We created an ad that connects the IKEA FAMILY discount with the functionality of a pregnancy test, in a tongue-in-cheek kind of way. One of the most incredible moments in life is when that test comes out positive. But there are more urgent things to consider at that moment.

134,﻿snes-02161,Cancer is caused by a deficiency of vitamin B17 a condition that can be remedied with nutritional supplements.,"A SECRET HAS BEEN UNCOVERED: CANCER IS NOT A DISEASE BUT BUSINESS!
The word called cancer is a lie...
You might not believe this but cancer is not a disease; it is a business.
Sharing this wonderful post will expose many of the hidden hands of the world's manipulators and annoy them.
Do you know that the book ""World Without Cancer"" has up till now been prevented from being translated into many world languages?
Know this: there is no disease called cancer.
Cancer consists of only a deficiency of vitamin B17.
Afterwards, it was discovered that scurvy was just a deficiency of vitamin C.
Cancer is also just like that!
The colonizing world and the enemies of humanity established the cancer industry and made it into a business.
The cancer industry flourished after world war II.
To fight cancer, all these delays, details and enormous expenditures are not needed.
They only go to line the pockets of colonizers, especially since the cure for the condition was found long ago.
The prevention and cure of cancer will be obtained simply through the following strategies:
Since cancer is only a deficiency of vitamin B17, eating 15 to 20 pieces of apricot stone/nucleus (fruit stone) everyday is enough.
Eat wheat bud (wheat sprouts).
Wheat bud is a miraculous anti-cancer medicine.
It is a rich source of liquid oxygen and the strongest anti-cancer matter named laetrile.
This matter is present in the fruit stone of apple and is the extracted form of vitamin B17 (Amygdalin).
Sources of Amygdalin (Vitamin B17)
The foods containing vitamin B17 include the following:
This contains the highest amount of vitamin B17 in nature.
This includes fruit stone of apple, apricot, peach, pear, and prune (dried plum).
-Common beans, corns(grains), which include bean, lentil sprout (lentil bud) Lima (Lima beans) and pea.
-Kernels: Bitter Almond (Richest source of vitamin B-17 in nature) and Indian almond.
This vitamin is found in grains and fruit stones of apricot, brewer's yeast, rough rice (paddy) and sweetmeat pumpkin.
List of Anti-Cancer Foods
•seeds from other fruits like apples, cherries, peaches, prunes, plums, pears
•Lima beans
•Fava beans
All are the highest sources of absorbable vitamin B17.
Ingesting dishwashing liquids (used in the kitchen) and hand washing liquid (used in the restroom) bis the main cancer causing factor so your eating of them should be restricted.
However, you daily wash your hands with hand washing liquid and wash your plates with dishwashing liquid.
The liquid is absorbed and will not leave the plate with washing.
When cooking or eating food, the soap in the plate or dish gets attached to the hot food and so we end up eating the dishwashing liquid with our food.
But the solution is to pour half of the dishwashing liquid and hand washing liquid and top it up with vinegar.
Do not eat blood cancer causing agents and also save your family from this danger.
Ways to beat cancer- Laetrile

Cancer consists of only a deficiency of vitamin B17.
Since cancer is only a deficiency of vitamin B17, eating 15 to 20 pieces of apricot stone/nucleus (fruit stone) everyday is enough.
Wheat bud is a miraculous anti-cancer medicine.
It is a rich source of liquid oxygen and the strongest anti-cancer matter named laetrile.
This matter is present in the fruit stone of apple and is the extracted form of vitamin B17 (Amygdalin).
This vitamin is found in grains and fruit stones of apricot, brewer's yeast, rough rice (paddy) and sweetmeat pumpkin.
Ingesting dishwashing liquids (used in the kitchen) and hand washing liquid (used in the restroom) bis the main cancer causing factor so your eating of them should be restricted.

When stroke strikes, the capillaries in the brain will gradually burst.
When a stroke occurs, stay calm.
Help the victim to sit up where he is to prevent him from falling over.
Place the needle/pin over fire to sterilize it, and then use it to prick the tip of all 10 fingers.
Prick till blood comes out.
If blood does not start to drip, then squeeze with your fingers.
When all 10 digits is bleeding, wait a few minutes then the victim
If the victim's mouth is crooked, then pull on his ears until they are red.
Then prick each ear lobe twice until two drops of blood comes from each ear lobe.
After a few minutes the victim should regain consciousness.
Wait till the victim regain his normal state without any abnormal symptoms then take him to the hospital, otherwise, if he was taken in the ambulance in a hurry to the hospital, the bumpy trip will cause all the capillaries in his brain to burst.
I learned about letting blood to save life from Chinese traditional doctor Ha Bu-Ting who lives in Sun-Juke.
Therefore I can say this method is 100% effective.
One afternoon I was teaching class when another teacher came running to my classroom and said in panting, ""Mr. Liu, come quick, our supervisor has had a stroke!"" I immediately went to the 3rd floor.
When I saw our supervisor, Mr. Chen Fu-Tien, his color was off, his speech was slurred, and his mouth was crooked - all the symptoms of a stroke.
I immediately asked one of the practicum students to go to the pharmacy outside the school to buy a syringe, which I used to prick Mr. Chen's 10 finger tips.
When all 10 fingers were bleeding (each with a pea-sized drop of blood), after a few minutes, Mr. Chen's face regained its color and his eyes' spirit returned, too.
But his mouth was still crooked.
So I pulled on his ears to fill them with blood.
When his ears became red, I pricked his right earlobe twice to let out 2 drops of blood.
When both earlobes had two drops of blood each, a miracle happened.
Within 3-5 minutes the shape of his mouth returned to normal and his speech became clear.
He rested one night and was released the next day to return to school to teach.
On the other hand, the usual stroke victim usually suffers irreparable bursting of the brain capillaries on the way to the hospital.
As a result, these victims never recover.
Therefore stroke is the no.
The lucky ones will stay alive but remain paralyzed for life.
It is such a horrible thing to happen in one's life.
If we can all remember this bloodletting method and start the life-saving process immediately, in a short time, the victim will be revived and regain 100% normality.
We hope you can tell others about this first aid method.

136,﻿snes-03331,Women need more sleep than men because their brains get more use on a day-to-day basis.,"WOMEN NEED MORE SLEEP THAN MEN BECAUSE OF THEIR 'COMPLEX' BRAINS, RESEARCH SUGGESTS
Women tend to require more sleep than men because of their ""complex"" brains, according to research.
Scientists found that around 20 minutes more sleep was needed by women compared to men - and said this was thought to be because the female brain works harder during the day.
The study was carried out on a sample set of 210 middle-aged men and women.
""One of the major functions of sleep is to allow the brain to recover and repair itself,"" study author Jim Horne, a sleep expert formerly director of the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University, told the Mail Online.
""During deep sleep, the cortex - the part of the brain responsible for thought memory, language and so on - disengages from the senses and goes into recovery mode.""
Prof Horn said the amount of sleep was necessitated by the complexity and intensity of brain activity during the day.
He said: ""The more of your brain you use during the day, the more of it that needs to recover and, consequently, the more sleep you need.
""Women tend to multi-task - they do lots at once and are flexible - and so they use more of their actual brain than men do. Because of that, their sleep need is greater.
""The average is 20 minutes more, but some women may need slightly more or less than this.""
However, he said men who have complex jobs which involve a lot of ""decision-making and lateral thinking"" are also likely to need more sleep than the average male.
The study also found that poor sleep among women was linked to a number of side effects. Increased levels of psychological distress and greater feelings of hostility, depression, and anger were all found in women who slept poorly, but not men.",uppercase words </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible,False,"Women need more sleep than men because their brains get more use on a day-to-day basis. </s></s> WOMEN NEED MORE SLEEP THAN MEN BECAUSE OF THEIR 'COMPLEX' BRAINS, RESEARCH SUGGESTS

Dear Friends,
My name is Antonia Foraker from Delight, WV. My youngest daughter, Savannah, was diagnosed with a rare blood disease in January of 2000. Savannah, who will turn four on February 29, is a bright, happy young girl who likes watching Sesame Street and playing with her two older sisters.
Unfortunately, there isn't much doctors can do for her right now. Our medical costs have become extremely expensive. Three local companies have promised to give $.05 each for every time this email is forwarded.
If you wouldn't mind forwarding this to everyone on your list I would greatly appreciate it as well as my daughter. Your good deeds could really save her life. Please take a few seconds to help us in our time of need. I know how many of these go around and I want you to know that they really help, if you would like to contact us, our e-mail address is: <foraker0401@yahoo.com>
Please have a heart and forward this.
Thank you,

He said she was just have an allergic reaction to something and gave her some cream to rub on her jaw to help.
After a couple of days the swelling had just gotten worse and she could hardly move her jaw. She went back to her doctor to see what was wrong. Her doctor had no idea so he started to run some test. They scrubbed out the inside of her mouth to get tissue samples and they also took some saliva samples. Well they found out what was
wrong.

BYMOLLIE BLOUDOFF-INDELICATO
PUBLISHED OCTOBER 1, 2013
• 3 MIN READ
Just in time for holiday cookie season, we've discovered that the vanilla flavoring in your baked goods and candy could come from the anal excretions of beavers.
Beaver butts secrete a goo called castoreum, which the animals use to mark their territory.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration lists castoreum as a ""generally regarded as safe"" additive, and manufacturers have been using it extensively in perfumes and foods for at least 80 years, according to a 2007 study in the International Journal of Toxicology.
""I lift up the animal's tail,"" said Joanne Crawford, a wildlife ecologist at Southern Illinois University, ""and I'm like, 'Get down there, and stick your nose near its bum.'""
""People think I'm nuts,"" she added.
""I tell them, 'Oh, but it's beavers; it smells really good.'""
Castoreum is a chemical compound that mostly comes from a beaver's castor sacs, which are located between the pelvis and the base of the tail.
Because of its close proximity to the anal glands, castoreum is often a combination of castor gland secretions, anal gland secretions, and urine.
The fragrant, brown slime is about the consistency of molasses, though not quite as thick, Crawford said.
While most anal secretions stink-due to odor-producing bacteria in the gut-this chemical compound is a product of the beaver's unique diet of leaves and bark, Crawford added.
Instead of smelling icky, castoreum has a musky, vanilla scent, which is why food scientists like to incorporate it in recipes.
Save a Cow, Milk a Beaver
But getting a beaver to produce castoreum for purposes of food processing is tough.
Foodies bent on acquiring some of the sticky stuff have to anesthetize the animal and then ""milk"" its nether regions.
(Read about scientists who milk mice.)
""You can milk the anal glands so you can extract the fluid,"" Crawford said.
""You can squirt [castoreum] out.
It's pretty gross.""
Due to such unpleasantness for both parties, castoreum consumption is rather small-only about 292 pounds (132 kilograms) yearly.
That statistic includes castoreum, castoreum extract, and castoreum liquid, according to Fenaroli's Handbook of Flavor Ingredients.
Still concerned you're chowing down on beaver-bum goop?
Because of its FDA label, in some cases, manufacturers don't have to list castoreum on the ingredient list and may instead refer to it as ""natural flavoring.""

142,﻿snes-03071,"Placing a raw, cut onion in contact with your foot overnight purifies your blood removes and heals your body.","Benefits of Onions - Health Hair and Happiness
Onion is one such source of healing and the many benefits of onions for health and beauty are now being understood for the first time.
Origins of Onions - 7,000 years of the benefits of onions
Onions have been  been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7,000 years as a food source.
In <a> Bronze Age <a> settlements, traces of onion remains were found alongside date stones and fig remains that date back to 5000 BC.
Amongst the other benefits of onions, the juice of onions has been used as a moth repellent and can be rubbed on the skin to prevent insect bites.
When applied to the scalp,onion juice  is said to promote growth of hair.
Onion juice has also  been used to polish glass and copper!
The article and video below focus on the many health benefits of onions and give  fascinating insights to some of its unusual properties.
So next time you handle an onion in your kitchen - have a little respect and think for a moment about what a miracle this little vegetable really  is!
Benefits of Onions: Natural Healing 
Onions may bring tears to your eyes but the momentary pain they cause is easily outweighed by the fact that they can also help fight  diseases.
They can be eaten alone, added to dishes to increase the flavor, used to clean barbecue grills, and even placed in ears or socks at night to help heal our bodies.
You read that last part correct; onions can help fight colds, fevers, and flu-like symptoms.
Benefits of Onions:  Earache
Grab an onion, cut it open, and take out the central-most portion of it.
Place the onion heart in the opening of your ear before you go to sleep and when you wake up you should feel much better.
The onion will soften any built up ear wax and make it easier to remove.
It also works overnight to naturally and effectively decrease any inflammation in the ear that is causing you pain.
Benefits of Onions: For Your Feet
The practice of placing onions on people's feet can be traced back to ancient Chinese medicine.
When a cut onion is placed on the underside of the foot it kills germs and bacteria because onions naturally have strong anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties.
How to use onions for your feet
Here's how to do it: Take an onion, red or white both work, and cut it into flat slices so they can be easily applied to the bottom of your feet.
Pull on a pair of socks over the onions to keep them in place overnight, lay back, sleep, wake up, remove the socks, and discard the onions.

143,﻿snes-06234,A virus deadly to dogs has been spreading in the canine population of the U.S.,"Deadly dog flu jumped from horses
The deadly canine flu that has been making domestic dogs and racing greyhounds ill in the US jumped from horses in a ""very rare event"", say scientists.
Although the possibility that the virus could also jump to humans cannot be ruled out, scientists are urging calm.
But researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta say they will be monitoring human exposure.
The flu affecting dogs is markedly different from human flu and the bird flu currently raging in Southeast Asia, which has infected and killed humans.
The virus infecting canines is a type A influenza virus called H3N8.
The name refers to the subtype of two proteins vital to the virus's life cycle, haemagglutinin and neuraminidase.
Researchers have now shown that the dog flu, which decimated racing greyhounds in Florida in January 2004 and has since spread across the east coast, originated in horses.
""We must keep in mind that this H3N8 equine influenza virus has been in horses for over 40 years.
In all these years, we have never been able to document a single case of human infection,"" notes Ruben Donis, chief of molecular genetics for the influenza branch of the CDC, who led the study.
The study was prompted after Cynthia Crawford at the College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, started investigating an outbreak of acute respiratory disease among racing greyhounds in the state in 2004.
Phylogenetic analysis - tracing back the dog virus's recent evolutionary history - suggested that there was a single event where the entire virus jumped from a horse to a dog.
It then spread horizontally through the dog population, suggests the team.
When the team checked archived samples of serum from sick greyhounds in Florida, they found antibodies to H3N8 as far back as 2000.
The researchers say viral transfer from horse to dog, followed by sustained transmission from dog to dog, is ""unprecedented"".
In the current human cases of bird flu, the virus jumps from birds virtually unchanged but does not then cause infections in other people.
More usually, interspecies outbreaks begin either when a flu virus mutates, or when two strains swap genes after infecting the same host.
That can produce a new virus, which then spreads through the host population.
Between January and May 2005 there were respiratory disease outbreaks among about 20,000 greyhounds at 20 tracks in 11 states, from Arizona to Massachusetts.
Samples from dogs at seven Florida tracks revealed they had been exposed to dog flu.
In a CDC briefing on Monday, Crawford said that between April and May 2005, the deadly flu had also crossed over to domestic dogs.
However, as with human flu, in a minority of cases there may be complications and the dogs can develop pneumonia.
If their dog has had a respiratory illness it should be kept at home for two weeks, says Crawford, to let it recover and prevent other dogs becoming infected.
The team says work on a vaccine for the new dog flu has been under way for a few months.",emotional appeals </s> fear </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> emotional appeals </s> fear </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified,True,"A virus deadly to dogs has been spreading in the canine population of the U.S. </s></s> Deadly dog flu jumped from horses

144,﻿snes-05190,"Israel has banned the sale of Heinz brand ketchup, partially due to the product's use of GMO-derived ingredients","Heinz Ketchup Banned (And Why You Should Avoid It)
Israel has recently banned Heinz Ketchup from the country and they say it's because it doesn't have high enough amount of tomatoes in it.
We know it's delicious but for your own sake stop consuming Heinz ketchup for good.
In recent years people have started turning away from processed food and focusing more on healthy living and eating organic, raw food.
This is a result of high toxins and chemical levels in processed food which is extremely unhealthy for our organism.
People have started avoiding processed food but they are unaware that the condiments they still use are considered processed and extremely unhealthy too.
Ketchup is one of these unhealthy foods we have forgotten to rule out from our diet.
These are the 3 main reasons why you should stop consuming ketchup:
It contains high fructose corn syrup <b> 
Heinz is loaded with high fructose corn syrup which is extremely unhealthy.
The corn syrup is made of GMO corn and this is what makes it so dangerous.
It can cause a rapid increase in your blood sugar levels and damage your liver.
If you are a regular user of high fructose corn syrup it can lead to an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and obesity.
If you're still not convinced, we'll share the results of a recent study about high fructose corn syrup which revealed that it's loaded with mercury - a toxic heavy metal!
Doctors are the first to advise you against eating foods which contain this hidden toxin!
It contains distilled vinegar and sugar <b>
Another fact about Heinz ketchup which you probably didn't know is that it contains distilled vinegar and sugar, which is another reason why you should ban in from your meals.
Just one tablespoon of this ketchup contains 4 grams of sugar, and by adding it to your meals you're adding sugars without even knowing it.
Just like corn syrup, distilled vinegar derives from GMO corn.
During growth GMO corn is treated with chemicals and pesticides and they end up on your plate through the ketchup.
Consuming distilled vinegar and sugar which have GMO background has no benefits and is extremely dangerous for your health.
It's a fact that excessive sugar consumption without fibers or other beneficial ingredients can lead to decreased blood sugar levels and live and pancreas damages.
The third reason why you should stop using Heinz ketchup as a condiment is that there are no beneficial nutrients in it.
It doesn't have fibers, proteins or other nutritive ingredients and the unnoticeable amount of tomato it contains has just slight traces of lycopene.
All that Heinz ketchup contains is sugar, GMOs and chemicals and has no benefit for your organism whatsoever.
It's not just the ketchup, we are constantly using empty condiments which have no nutritional value but only harm our health.
If you truly want to live a healthy life and have a healthy body you need to buy GMO free and organic products.","distinctive linguistic features </s> bolded, underline or italicized </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> shifting hypothesis </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> emotional appeals </s> fear </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> emotional appeals </s> fear </s> bolded, underline or italicized </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> shifting hypothesis </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> bolded, underline or italicized </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> shifting hypothesis </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - words associated with nature or healthiness </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to not be credible in this context </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> bolded, underline or italicized",False,"Israel has banned the sale of Heinz brand ketchup, partially due to the product's use of GMO-derived ingredients </s></s> Israel has recently banned Heinz Ketchup from the country and they say it's because it doesn't have high enough amount of tomatoes in it.

We know it's delicious but for your own sake stop consuming Heinz ketchup for good.
In recent years people have started turning away from processed food and focusing more on healthy living and eating organic, raw food.

Heinz is loaded with high fructose corn syrup which is extremely unhealthy.
If you're still not convinced, we'll share the results of a recent study about high fructose corn syrup which revealed that it's loaded with mercury - a toxic heavy metal!

Another fact about Heinz ketchup which you probably didn't know is that it contains distilled vinegar and sugar, which is another reason why you should ban in from your meals.

There's yet another use for marijuana: It may help to heal broken bones, according to a new study.
Researchers found that cannabidiol - an element of marijuana that does not get people high - improved the healing process in rats with broken leg bones after eight weeks, according to a study published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research by Tel Aviv University and Hebrew University.
Yankel Gabet of Tel Aviv's Bone Research Laboratory who led the study, said it found that the element ""makes bones stronger during healing,"" which could prevent future fractures.
This process occurs as cannabidiol, or CBD, enhances the maturation of collagen, the protein in connective tissue that ""holds the body together.""
""After being treated with CBD, the healed bone will be harder to break in the future,"" Gabet said in a news release.
The results of the study provide another glimpse into the potential health benefits of marijuana.
Medicinal marijuana is already used to reduce some of the effects associated with chemotherapy in cancer patients.
It is also used as treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.
In earlier research, Gabet's team learned that the body's cannabinoid receptors ""stimulated bone formation and inhibited bone loss."" Those findings open doors to how marijuana could treat osteoporosis and other bone-related diseases, the researchers say.
Marijuana is still largely illegal across the world and in the United States.
But marijuana prescribed for medical uses is legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia.
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug ""with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse"" alongside heroin and LSD.
Although that classification is unlikely to change this year, attempts and events that challenge marijuana's status in the nation have not gone unnoticed.
According to Gabet, ""there is still a lot of work to be done to develop appropriate therapies"" in using marijuana medically, but ""it is possible to detach a clinical therapy objective"" from the mood-changing aspects of the stoner's plant.

152,﻿snes-00714,"A ""new"" study has demonstrated that marijuana leads to a ""complete remission"" of Crohn's disease.	
Original","Medical Marijuana Achieves 'Complete Remission' Of Crohn's Disease; Drug Improves Appetite And Sleep Function, With No Side Effects 
Crohn's disease, one of several inflammatory bowel diseases, achieved ""complete remission"" in nearly half the subjects of one study that were exposed to smoking medical marijuana on a regular basis.
Published in the journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, the study examined the effects of consistent marijuana use on Crohn's patients who suffered from severe cases of the disease.
The results of the 21-subject study point toward the drug's anti-inflammatory properties as being responsible for quieting symptoms in many patients, and even reaching total remission in others.
The Disease: Causes, Symptoms, And Treatments
Symptoms of the disease range from mild abdominal pain to more severe cases of bloody diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and fevers.
There is no cure for Crohn's; however, various methods are aimed at limiting flare ups and keeping the disease in remission.
Treatments, like disease severity, fall on a spectrum depending on the person.
Corticosteroids and other medications are also prescribed for less severe cases.
The disease affects around 400,000 to 600,000 people in North America, although many people do not get diagnosed until they've had the disease for years, simply because no symptoms were present.
The Study And Its Findings
Scientists at Meir Medical Center in Israel wanted to examine the effects of Cannabis sativa on patients with severe Crohn's disease, relying on the underlying drug's anti-inflammatory effects in treating other ailments, such as arthritis and multiple sclerosis.
""The marijuana plant Cannabis sativa has been reported to produce beneficial effects for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, but this has not been investigated in controlled trials,"" the researchers wrote.
""We performed a prospective trial to determine whether cannabis can induce remission in patients with Crohn's disease.""
Twenty-one people with severe, intractable Crohn's comprised the study.
Out of those 21, 11 subjects smoked two joints a day for eight weeks.
In total, five of the 11 subjects smoking marijuana daily achieved total remission of their Crohn's.
(People with severe cases of Crohn's sometimes defecate 20 times per day, and may even wake up at night to do so.) Moreover, ""a clinical response"" was found in 10 of those 11.
Only four of the 10 placebo subjects reported any improvements.
These findings, argued the researchers, demonstrate how ""THC-rich cannabis produced significant clinical, steroid-free benefits to 11 patients with active Crohn's disease, compared with placebo, without side effects.""
The researchers were hesitant to call the study a total success, however, saying that the ""primary end point of the study (induction of remission) was not achieved,"" despite the five of 11 people who reported those effects.
""Further studies, with larger patient groups and a nonsmoking mode of intake, are warranted,"" they wrote, pointing to the potentially diminished effects of smoking marijuana, as opposed to extracting the anti-inflammatory drugs directly from the plant.

The results of the 21-subject study point toward the drug's anti-inflammatory properties as being responsible for quieting symptoms in many patients, and even reaching total remission in others.
Scientists at Meir Medical Center in Israel wanted to examine the effects of Cannabis sativa on patients with severe Crohn's disease, relying on the underlying drug's anti-inflammatory effects in treating other ailments, such as arthritis and multiple sclerosis.
""The marijuana plant Cannabis sativa has been reported to produce beneficial effects for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, but this has not been investigated in controlled trials,"" the researchers wrote.
""We performed a prospective trial to determine whether cannabis can induce remission in patients with Crohn's disease.""
Twenty-one people with severe, intractable Crohn's comprised the study.
In total, five of the 11 subjects smoking marijuana daily achieved total remission of their Crohn's.
(People with severe cases of Crohn's sometimes defecate 20 times per day, and may even wake up at night to do so.) Moreover, ""a clinical response"" was found in 10 of those 11.
Only four of the 10 placebo subjects reported any improvements.
These findings, argued the researchers, demonstrate how ""THC-rich cannabis produced significant clinical, steroid-free benefits to 11 patients with active Crohn's disease, compared with placebo, without side effects.""
The researchers were hesitant to call the study a total success, however, saying that the ""primary end point of the study (induction of remission) was not achieved,"" despite the five of 11 people who reported those effects.
""Further studies, with larger patient groups and a nonsmoking mode of intake, are warranted,"" they wrote, pointing to the potentially diminished effects of smoking marijuana, as opposed to extracting the anti-inflammatory drugs directly from the plant.

Evidence of how negatively fluoride can impact our health has been increasing in rapid pace throughout the past few years. People are hoping that by bringing awareness to this that somehow we can get sodium fluoride removed from the world's water supply.
A big step has been made here recently. In the most prestigious medical journal. One known as The Lancet. fluoride has been at last classified as a neurotoxin one hundred percent. This puts it in the same category as things like lead, arsenic, and mercury.
This news was released by the author Stefan Smyle who actually cited a report that had been published in The Lancet Neurology, Volume 13, Issue 3 to be exact in the March of 2014 edition. In this, the authors stated that many more of these neurotoxins remain undiscovered throughout the world. They noted that many children are now being affected by neurodevelopmental disabilities caused by these neurotoxins. These authors have found that while fluoride in our water supplies is a major cause an issue there is another major cause as well, fluoride can actually also be found in heavily processed brands of tea that are grown in most likely overly polluted areas.

155,﻿snes-02768,"Prolonged sexual arousal in men without an ejaculation can cause pain, a condition colloquially referred to as ""blue balls"".","Yes, Blue Balls Are A Real Thing And This Is Why Guys Get Them
Let's talk about blue balls.
A lot of people seem to believe it's a myth, but this couldn't be further from the truth.
It's a real problem impacting countless men across the globe.
At this very moment, there are at least two billion men with blue balls; it's an epidemic.
Just kidding.
We actually have no idea how many men have blue balls right now.
And now that we're really thinking about it, we don't want to know.
But there is a science behind why men get this uncomfortable feeling and why it's been labeled as such.
Before we get into it, however, it might be helpful to define or describe blue balls for those unfamiliar with the term.
Blue balls is the painful and dull aching sensation a man gets in the testicular region following protracted sexual arousal without climax.
In other words, it's probably similar to how women feel after sex the vast majority of the time, only this disappointment is focused in one specific area.
Twitter users also offer helpful summaries of this topic:
When you feel like you have to sneeze but can't, it's like getting blue balls for your face — Matt Bueckert (@mattbueckert) March 4, 2015
just got blue balls from the new avengers trailer.
— Chris Pizza Kitson (@ChrisKillUs) March 4, 2015
There is widespread debate over treatment for this pain, which includes everything from cold showers to manual stimulation and sleeping it off.
Most agree that ejaculation is the only real solution to this issue.
Simply put, sexual healing is real in this sense.
Even after orgasm, however, a man might find the pain hasn't fully dissipated.
Don't worry, if you happen to experience this dreaded sensation, be comforted by knowing it will eventually subside one way or another.
Now let's explain why men sometimes experience this discomfort.
It all has to do with what is known as epididymal hypertension, the medical term for blue balls.
In essence, when a man gets aroused, blood flows to the penis and scrotum, causing everything to become engorged.
Pressure will continue to build up in this area until ejaculation.
Thus, if he remains aroused for an extended period of time, the pressure could lead to the pain we often refer to as blue balls.
Moreover, as Men's Health notes, it might even cause his testicles to turn a darker color, hence the colloquial name for the condition.
Indeed, this is a very real problem; science says so.
But let's not forget about the ladies' suffering, too.
There is evidence only around 70 percent of women are able to orgasm during intercourse, according to a study from the Kinsey Institute.
Blue balls are very much a real thing and now you know the science behind the condition.

Blue balls is the painful and dull aching sensation a man gets in the testicular region following protracted sexual arousal without climax.

Even after orgasm, however, a man might find the pain hasn't fully dissipated.
Now let's explain why men sometimes experience this discomfort.
It all has to do with what is known as epididymal hypertension, the medical term for blue balls.
Thus, if he remains aroused for an extended period of time, the pressure could lead to the pain we often refer to as blue balls.
Indeed, this is a very real problem; science says so.
Blue balls are very much a real thing and now you know the science behind the condition.

It's a real problem impacting countless men across the globe.
At this very moment, there are at least two billion men with blue balls; it's an epidemic.
We actually have no idea how many men have blue balls right now.

In other words, it's probably similar to how women feel after sex the vast majority of the time, only this disappointment is focused in one specific area.

Most agree that ejaculation is the only real solution to this issue.
Simply put, sexual healing is real in this sense.
Even after orgasm, however, a man might find the pain hasn't fully dissipated.
Don't worry, if you happen to experience this dreaded sensation, be comforted by knowing it will eventually subside one way or another.
Now let's explain why men sometimes experience this discomfort.
It all has to do with what is known as epididymal hypertension, the medical term for blue balls.
In essence, when a man gets aroused, blood flows to the penis and scrotum, causing everything to become engorged.
Thus, if he remains aroused for an extended period of time, the pressure could lead to the pain we often refer to as blue balls.
Moreover, as Men's Health notes, it might even cause his testicles to turn a darker color, hence the colloquial name for the condition.
Indeed, this is a very real problem; science says so.
There is evidence only around 70 percent of women are able to orgasm during intercourse, according to a study from the Kinsey Institute.

156,﻿snes-01965,"A man in Stockholm, Sweden died from a fat embolism after undergoing penis enlargement surgery.","Man dies from penis enlargement surgery in first ever fatal case
The first case of a man killed by penis enlargement surgery has been reported in Sweden.
A healthy 30-year-old had wanted to increase both the girth and length of his genitals using a process where fat is transferred from his stomach.
They then began the enlargement and had planned to inject two fluid ounces of fat cells.
Yet, before they finished the injection, his heart began racing, his oxygen levels fell, and his blood pressure dropped, and he then suffered a heart attack, reports the Journal of Forensic Sciences.
The patient, who had mild asthma, but otherwise no past medical history, died from a fat embolism, the report's authors state.
This occurs when fat tissue passes into the bloodstream and lodges within the blood vessels of the lung and other sites, resulting in respiratory failure.
While this is the first reported death from this kind of surgery, experts say it often leads to other serious problems.
He said: 'This is the worst case, but there are lots of other horrible consequences, from disfigurement to permanent erectile disfunction to even worse.' 
Furthermore, one expert has warned that the risks are not worth taking and results are often disappointing.
Sexual medicine consultant Professor Kevan Wylie said studies that followed men up over a longer time suggest disappointing results, with complications including disfigurement, scarring, lumpiness and infection.
He says the use of biodegradable frames has had better results than fat injection, reports the NHS.
Professor Wylie said: 'The problem with injecting fat is that over time, the body will re-absorb the fat which can result in a return to the penis' original size.'
He adds that penis enlargements can result in an average gain in length to the flaccid penis of 2cm, but there will be no change to the size of the erect penis.
Furthermore, the erect penis will not point as high as before the surgery because the ligament which was cut no longer offers support.
'A lot of men who have this treatment don't truly appreciate this loss of angle,' says Professor Wylie.
The advantage of a 2cm gain in flaccid length is far outweighed by the loss of angle of erection.' 
Increasing the girth of a penis is called lipofilling, which involves injecting fat from a patient's stomach or legs into the genitals - adding one inch in circumference.
Doctors can also utilise platelet-rich plasma (PRP) - which is commonly used in facial rejuvenation - to increase a penis's girth.
PRP involves taking blood from the patient - with the plasma and platelets enriched with growth factors, and mixing it with fat.
Penoplasty procedures to increase girth start from £4,500 ($6,400).
Meanwhile, penoplasty procedures for increased girth and length starts from £6,500 ($9,250).
Furthermore, the PRP treatment is an additional £800 ($1,140) and bank storage of fat for top-up procedures £1,800 ($2,561).
Yet, procedures to increase girth may only last up to a few years, experts have warned.",narrative with details_details verified to be true </s> narrative with details </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> establishing legitimacy </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> uppercase words </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> establishing legitimacy,True,"A man in Stockholm, Sweden died from a fat embolism after undergoing penis enlargement surgery. </s></s> Man dies from penis enlargement surgery in first ever fatal case

157,﻿tron-02226,Aborted Babies Incinerated To Heat U.K. Hospitals,"Aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals
The bodies of thousands of aborted and miscarried babies were incinerated as clinical waste, with some even used to heat hospitals, an investigation has found.
Ten NHS trusts have admitted burning foetal remains alongside other rubbish while two others used the bodies in 'waste-to-energy' plants which generate power for heat.
Last night the Department of Health issued an instant ban on the practice which health minister Dr Dan Poulter branded 'totally unacceptable.'
At least 15,500 foetal remains were incinerated by 27 NHS trusts over the last two years alone, Channel 4's Dispatches discovered.
The programme, which will air tonight, found that parents who lose children in early pregnancy were often treated without compassion and were not consulted about what they wanted to happen to the remains
One of the country's leading hospitals, Addenbrooke's in Cambridge, incinerated 797 babies below 13 weeks gestation at their own 'waste to energy' plant.
The mothers were told the remains had been 'cremated.'
Another 'waste to energy' facility at Ipswich Hospital, operated by a private contractor, incinerated 1,101 foetal remains between 2011 and 2013.
They were brought in from another hospital before being burned, generating energy for the hospital site.
Ipswich Hospital itself disposes of remains by cremation.
""This practice is totally unacceptable,"" said Dr Poulter.
""While the vast majority of hospitals are acting in the appropriate way, that must be the case for all hospitals and the Human Tissue Authority has now been asked to ensure that it acts on this issue without delay.""
Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS Medical Director, has written to all NHS trusts to tell them the practice must stop.
The Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies, has also written to the Human Tissue Authority to ask them make sure that guidance is clear.
And the Care Quality Commission said it would investigate the programme's findings.
Prof Sir Mike Richards, Chief Inspector of Hospitals, said: ""I am disappointed trusts may not be informing or consulting women and their families.
""This breaches our standard on respecting and involving people who use services and I'm keen for Dispatches to share their evidence with us.
""We scrutinise information of concern and can inspect unannounced, if required.""
A total of one in seven pregnancies ends in a miscarriage, while NHS figures show there are around 4,000 stillbirths each year in the UK, or 11 each day.
Ipswich Hospital Trust said it was concerned to discover that foetal remains from another hospital had been incinerated on its site.
A spokeswoman said: ""The Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust does not incinerate foetal remains.""
She added that the trust ""takes great care over foetal remains""
A spokesman for the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said that trained health professionals discuss the options with parents 'both verbally and in writing.'
""The parents are given exactly the same choice on the disposal of foetal remains as for a stillborn child and their personal wishes are respected,"" they added.

Ten NHS trusts have admitted burning foetal remains alongside other rubbish while two others used the bodies in 'waste-to-energy' plants which generate power for heat.
At least 15,500 foetal remains were incinerated by 27 NHS trusts over the last two years alone, Channel 4's Dispatches discovered.
The programme, which will air tonight, found that parents who lose children in early pregnancy were often treated without compassion and were not consulted about what they wanted to happen to the remains
One of the country's leading hospitals, Addenbrooke's in Cambridge, incinerated 797 babies below 13 weeks gestation at their own 'waste to energy' plant.
Another 'waste to energy' facility at Ipswich Hospital, operated by a private contractor, incinerated 1,101 foetal remains between 2011 and 2013.
Ipswich Hospital itself disposes of remains by cremation.
""This practice is totally unacceptable,"" said Dr Poulter.
Prof Sir Mike Richards, Chief Inspector of Hospitals, said: ""I am disappointed trusts may not be informing or consulting women and their families.
Ipswich Hospital Trust said it was concerned to discover that foetal remains from another hospital had been incinerated on its site.
A spokeswoman said: ""The Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust does not incinerate foetal remains.""
She added that the trust ""takes great care over foetal remains""

158,﻿snes-04138,The FDA said Frosted Flakes are healthier than avocados,"According To The FDA, Frosted Flakes Are ""Healthier"" Than Avocados
ByBrianna Acuesta
The FDA has admitted that their rudimentary definition of the word ""healthy"" is outdated.

The Food and Drug Administration is an organization whose motives and influences have long been questioned by American citizens.
Many speculate that the organization has been bribed by Big Food companies who want a hold on what the FDA deems as healthy so that adults and children can be misguided about what to eat.
Based on a rudimentary system of saying that any food that's low in fat, sodium, and cholesterol, as well as full of some ""beneficial nutrients,"" many processed foods are healthier than wholesome produce in the eyes of the FDA.
The FDA also doesn't have a caveat that states that foods high in unsaturated fat (the healthy kind found in avocados, for example) are better than foods low in saturated fat.
This poses a problem, as the source of the fat and other components that make up food products and whether they were formed naturally is important and critical to the health of the person consuming it.
In a widely-circulated example of the absurdity of this logic, the FDA essentially says that Frosted Flakes, which are loaded with sugar and have minimal nutrients, are healthier than avocados.
Though the laws governing what is healthy have been long-standing, the outrage over them increased recently when the FDA wrote a 3,200 word letter to Kind snack food company, attacking them for calling their bars ""healthy.""
The organization demanded that Kind stop calling their bars healthy, even though the bars are full of antioxidants and essential fatty acids, and instead the FDA received backlash from angry citizens who actually know what ""healthy"" means.
In the heat of the backlash, the FDA admitted that their definition of what is good to consume was outdated and agreed to redefine the term.
Though this is promising, it's likely that their new definition will be equally as vague as the last in order to keep Big Food's products within the healthy range.
Since the word ""healthy"" can no longer be trusted, here are some other words that people see at the supermarket often but can be deceiving: wholesome, natural, and nutritious.
None of these terms are officially defined by the FDA and are therefore used on a range of very unwholesome, unnatural, and innutritious foods.
When it comes to health, the FDA doesn't have Americans' best interests in mind, meaning that consumers must do their own research if they hope to eat and drink products that might actually benefit them.

160,﻿snes-00957,Pepsi admitted that their soda contains cancer-causing ingredients.,"Pepsi admits its soda contains cancer-causing ingredients
(NaturalNews) When the Center for Environmental Health released test results showing that Pepsi intentionally covered up the presence of high levels of 4-Mel in its popular soft drinks in 2013, the company denied both the presence of this chemical in its beverages and the fact that it was dangerous.
4-Mel, which is short for 4-Methylimidazole, is a compound that is formed in the manufacturing of caramel coloring, and is a known carcinogen.
Since then, the drinks maker has fought against complying with California state requirements to place a cancer warning label on the beverages that contain the ingredient, which include not only Pepsi, but also Diet Pepsi and Pepsi One.
As part of the proposed settlement, Pepsi has agreed to ensure its caramel coloring's 4-Mel levels do not exceed 100 parts per billion in products that are being shipped for sale within the U.S. They will also be required to test the soda using specific protocols.
The soft drink giant also agreed to these measures in a different lawsuit that was settled in a California state court last year.
Pepsi failed to warn consumers that its drinks contain known carcinogens
The lawsuit accused Pepsi of failing to warn people that its beverages contain 4-Mel, which California has officially recognized as a cancer-causing chemical.
A 2014 Consumer Reports test showed that the 4-Mel in Pepsi exceeded the permitted level of 29 micrograms per bottle or can, which would mean that they were in violation of common law and consumer protection statutes in the state of California.
In particular, this violates California's Proposition 65, which has been in place since 1985, and requires manufacturers to provide consumers with clear warnings when their products will expose them to toxic or cancer-causing chemicals.
The state's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment set the cutoff at 29 micrograms because that level creates a risk of cancer of one in 100,000.
At the time, Pepsi tried to say that because Prop 65 refers to exposure per day rather than exposure per can, and that the average amount of diet soda that its drinkers consume daily is less than a can, there was no need to place a warning on it.
""No matter how much consumers drink they don't expect their beverages to have a potential carcinogen in them.
Is drinking soda really worth risking cancer and obesity?
It simply does not make sense for people to expose themselves unnecessarily to an ingredient that merely serves to color their food, and consumers have the right to be aware of what they are putting in their bodies.
The cancer-causing caramel coloring in Pepsi is not the only reason consumers should steer clear of it.
Moreover, drinking just one soda each day adds up to a total of 39 pounds of sugar each year!
That means that regular soda drinkers can cut their risk of obesity and cancer in one fell swoop simply by giving up the habit for good.

Since then, the drinks maker has fought against complying with California state requirements to place a cancer warning label on the beverages that contain the ingredient, which include not only Pepsi, but also Diet Pepsi and Pepsi One. As part of the proposed settlement, Pepsi has agreed to ensure its caramel coloring's 4-Mel levels do not exceed 100 parts per billion in products that are being shipped for sale within the U.S. They will also be required to test the soda using specific protocols.
The lawsuit accused Pepsi of failing to warn people that its beverages contain 4-Mel, which California has officially recognized as a cancer-causing chemical.
A 2014 Consumer Reports test showed that the 4-Mel in Pepsi exceeded the permitted level of 29 micrograms per bottle or can, which would mean that they were in violation of common law and consumer protection statutes in the state of California.
In particular, this violates California's Proposition 65, which has been in place since 1985, and requires manufacturers to provide consumers with clear warnings when their products will expose them to toxic or cancer-causing chemicals. </s></s> distrusting government or corporations </s> ingroup vs. outgroup </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> politicizing health issues </s> rhetorical tricks </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> evidence does not support conclusion </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> less robust evidence or outdated evidence_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be made up </s> politicizing health issues </s> less robust evidence or outdated evidence_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be made up </s> using anecdotes and personal experience as evidence </s> using anecdotes and personal experience as evidence </s> politicizing health issues </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified"

Immediately Throw It Spoiled Onions
Written by Zola Gorgon - author of several cookbooks.
Watch out for those spoiled onions...
I had the wonderful privilege of touring Mullins Food Products.
Mullins is HUGE and is owned by 11 brothers and sisters in the Mullins family.
My friend Jeanne is the CEO.
The facility is mammoth.
We toured about 280,000 square feet!
Questions about food poisoning came up and I wanted to share what I learned from a chemist.
The guy who gave us our tour is named Ed. He's one of the brothers.
Ed is a chemistry expert and is involved in developing most of the sauce formula.
He's even developed sauce formula for McDonald's.
Keep in mind that Ed is a food chemistry whiz.
During the tour, someone asked if we really needed to worry about mayonnaise.
People are always worried that mayonnaise will spoil.
Ed's answer will surprise you.
Ed said that all commercially-made Mayo is completely safe.
""It doesn't even have to be refrigerated.
No harm in refrigerating it, but it's not really necessary."" He explained that the pH in mayonnaise is set at a point that bacteria could not survive in that environment.
He then talked about the quint essential picnic, with the bowl of potato salad sitting on the table and how everyone blames the mayonnaise when someone gets sick.
Ed says that when food poisoning is reported, the first thing the officials look for is when the 'victim' last ate ONIONS and where those onions came from (in the potato salad?).
Ed says it's not the mayonnaise (as long as it's not homemade Mayo) that spoils in the outdoors.
It's probably the onions, and if not the onions, it's the POTATOES.
He explained, onions are a huge magnet for bacteria, especially uncooked onions.
You should never plan to keep a portion of a sliced onion.
He says it's not even safe if you put it in a zip-lock bag and put it in your refrigerator.
It's already contaminated enough just by being cut open and out for a bit, that it can be a danger to you (and doubly watch out for those onions you put in your hotdogs at the baseball park!)
Ed says if you take the leftover onion and cook it like crazy you'll probably be okay, but if you slice that leftover onion and put on your sandwich, you're asking for trouble.
Both the onions and the moist potato in a potato salad, will attract and grow bacteria faster than any commercial mayonnaise will even begin to break down.
So, how's that for news?
I (the author) am going to be very careful about my onions from now on.
For some reason, I see a lot of credibility coming from a chemist and a company, that produces millions of pounds of mayonnaise every year.'
Also, dogs should NEVER eat onions.

IPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine) cannot prevent transmission of poliovirus (see appendix for the scientific study, Item #1).
Despite being capable of preventing wild poliovirus transmission, use of OPV was phased out long ago in the USA and replaced with IPV due to safety concerns.
Vaccinating for tetanus (via the DTaP combination vaccine) cannot alter the safety of public spaces; it is intended to render personal protection only.
Vaccinating for diphtheria cannot alter the safety of public spaces; it is likewise intended for personal protection only.
Furthermore, the 2013 meeting of the Board of Scientific Counselors at the CDC revealed additional alarming data that pertussis variants (PRN-negative strains) currently circulating in the USA acquired a selective advantage to infect those who are up-to-date for their DTaP boosters (see appendix for the CDC document, Item #3), meaning that people who are up-to-date are more likely to be infected, and thus contagious, than people who are not vaccinated.
influenzae (types a through f).These types have been causing invasive disease of high severity and increasing incidence in adults in the era of Hib vaccination of children (see appendix for the scientific study, Item #4).
Discriminating against children who are not vaccinated for Hib does not make any scientific sense in the era of non-type b H.
Vaccinating children for hepatitis B cannot significantly alter the safety of public spaces.
In summary, a person who is not vaccinated with IPV, DTaP, HepB, and Hib vaccines due to reasons of conscience poses no extra danger to the public than a person who is.
Despite high chances of exposure in the pre-vaccination era, measles practically never happened in babies much younger than one year of age due to the robust maternal immunity transfer mechanism.
In summary: 1) due to the properties of modern vaccines, non-vaccinated individuals pose no greater risk of transmission of polio, diphtheria, pertussis, and numerous non-type b H.
influenza strains than vaccinated individuals do, non-vaccinated individuals pose virtually no danger of transmission of hepatitis B in a school setting, and tetanus is not transmissible at all; 2) there is a significantly elevated risk of emergency room visits after childhood vaccination appointments attesting that vaccination is  not risk-free; 3) outbreaks of measles cannot be entirely prevented even if we had nearly perfect vaccination compliance; and 4) an effective method of preventing measles and other viral diseases in vaccine-ineligible infants and the immunocompromised, immunoglobulin, is available for those who may be exposed to these diseases.

In summary, a person who is not vaccinated with IPV, DTaP, HepB, and Hib vaccines due to reasons of conscience poses no extra danger to the public than a person who is.
Despite high chances of exposure in the pre-vaccination era, measles practically never happened in babies much younger than one year of age due to the robust maternal immunity transfer mechanism.
Taken together, these four facts make it clear that discrimination in a public school setting against children who are not vaccinated for reasons of conscience is completely unwarranted as the vaccine status of conscientious objectors poses no undue public health risk. </s></s> title of article as clickbait </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> claims without evidence </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> shifting hypothesis </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to not be credible in this context",A Harvard study proved that unvaccinated children pose no risks to other kids. </s></s> distrusting government or corporations </s> politicizing health issues </s> ingroup vs. outgroup </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> politicizing health issues </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> politicizing health issues </s> less robust evidence or outdated evidence_verified </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be made up </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> politicizing health issues </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> less robust evidence or outdated evidence_verified </s> hope </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be made up </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> hope </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> hope </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> hope </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> hope </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> evidence does not support conclusion </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> evidence does not support conclusion </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> evidence does not support conclusion </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> uppercase words </s> politicizing health issues </s> less robust evidence or outdated evidence_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be made up </s> politicizing health issues </s> less robust evidence or outdated evidence_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be made up </s> politicizing health issues </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> politicizing health issues </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to not be credible in this context </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to not be credible in this context,"A Harvard study proved that unvaccinated children pose no risks to other kids. </s></s> People who have not received the vaccines mentioned below pose no higher threat to the general public than those who have, implying that discrimination against non-immunized children in a public school setting may not be warranted.

165,﻿tron-01429,Contaminated Lemon Slices in Restaurants,"The Serious Reason You Need to Stop Putting Lemon Wedges Into Your Water
Marissa LaliberteUpdated: Feb. 27, 2019
Guaranteed someone at your table will order one.
It's likely the first thing your server will ask when you sit down for a restaurant meal: What would you like to drink?
Well, there's one incredibly popular drink that you might not want to order.
Whether you ask for it or not, a glass of water or Diet Coke usually comes with a slice of lemon.
But be warned: Despite all the health benefits of lemon water, you might want to tell your server to leave the citrus out.
Don't miss these other 7 foods chefs never order at restaurants.
A 2007 study in the Journal of Environmental Health tested 76 lemons from 21 restaurants for germs and had some pretty freaky findings.
Nearly 70 percent of the lemon slices had bacteria, viruses, and other microbes-including disease-causing E.
coli.
Even though lemon is a natural germ-killer, it can still get contaminated itself.
Another ABC investigation testing one lemon at 10 different restaurants found that half the wedges contained human waste.
Gross!
Check out these other gross things restaurants do to save money.
Lemon wedges are way more likely to have bacteria than the food you order on a plate because restaurant health standards tend to be less strict for garnishes.
The ABC investigation noticed that restaurant workers often grabbed lemons without gloves or tongs.
If they didn't scrub their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom or touching another germ-ridden spot, there's a good chance they could leave that bacteria on the lemon in your drink.
Plus, restaurants might just rinse the skin instead of giving each fruit a good scrub.
But before you start giving servers the death glare when you see them carrying lemon water, know that the garnish won't necessarily make you sick.
The 2007 study authors admitted there haven't been any diseases or outbreaks linked to lemons, and that still holds true today.
And microbiology expert Philip Tierno, PhD, who led the ABC investigation, says your immune system will usually protect you from getting sick from lemon water.
Before sitting down at a table, watch out for these red flags you're about to eat at a bad restaurant.
""The usual course will probably result in no infection, but there is a possibility,"" Dr. Tierno, clinical professor of microbiology and pathology at NYU Langone Medical Center, tells the Huffington Post when discussing his findings.
""You can't live in a bubble.
Your immune system is usually pretty good.""
Still, if you're concerned, just request your server bring your water or soda with no lemon.
And if you can't live without it, try squeezing in the juice then setting the wedge aside.
Even though the juice has bacteria, at least you won't have germs from the rind floating in your glass, too.
Don't skip the lemon water at home though, because drinking lemon water has incredible health benefits.
Just make sure to wash it before putting it in your glass.

167,﻿tron-02223,Rand Paul's Summer Break Eye Surgeries,"Rand Paul leaves the campaign trail for eye surgeries in Haiti
This weekend, while the political world descends on Iowa's state fairgrounds, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) will be fixing cataracts 2000 miles away.
As he's done every summer recess since joining the Senate, Paul's performing pro bono eye surgery.
This year's mission, run and sponsored by the Moran Eye Center from the University of Utah, will take Paul to Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere.
""We kind of suggested it,"" said Paul in an interview.
""There was talk about Haiti being in great need, and it's fairly close to the United States.
Haiti, unfortunately, is famous for a long history of problems.""
In 2014, Paul joined the Moran center on a similar trip to Guatemala, where he reunited with old patients and broke out his rusty, Texas-tutored Spanish.
He has no similar connection to Haiti.
[video] 
This August 2014 video shows Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) in Guatemala on a medical mission trip.
Paul, a licensed ophthalmologist, checks the eyes of a patient and converses him via an interpreter.
(Video: Ed O'Keefe/The Washington Post)
""You want to go where the need is greatest,"" Paul said.
""In our country, when you have cataracts, they're relatively easy to fix.
The people we will treat in Haiti -- many of them will be completely blind.
There's less medical access there.
It's closer to the equator.
Paul's 2014 trip was balanced against a small media frenzy.
Multiple media outlets traveled with him, filming his journey and surgeries for profiles of a likely presidential contender.
David Bossie of the conservative Citizens United even brought a film crew -- complete with aerial drone -- to capture the scene.
Citizens United has not yet made use of that footage, and the entourage will be smaller in Haiti.
(The Washington Post will be part of it.) ""The main thing is for me personally is that it's one of the most incredible things I get to be involved with,"" said.
""It's still the most important thing I get to do, even while I'm in the Senate, even running for president.
Two hundred people will be better because we are going to be down there.
Local surgeons will get some training, and they'll use that training.
Paul was staying clear of politics, but he was making a point that jibed with his own views of foreign aid.
Training people, then trusting them to build their own lives, was always better than constant intervention.
Paul cited the example of Sanduk Ruit, a Nepalese doctor who designed a simplified kind of cataract surgery, because he had to work ""without sophisticated equipment"" -- and in the process, did something a Western doctor would never have thought to do.

168,﻿tron-01798,Flu Shots Cause Alzheimer's Disease,"Some Flu Shot Formulations Contain Brain-Destroying Toxin: Top Doctor
Although flu shots are promoted as safe, that's not true, says holistic family physician Dr. David Brownstein.
Flu shots contain several suspect ingredients, including the carcinogen formaldehyde, and many contain mercury in the form of thimerosal.
""Mercury is one of the most poisonous substances known to mankind,"" Dr. Brownstein tells Newsmax Health.
A study published by the National Institutes of Health stated: ""Mercury is a highly toxic element; there is no known safe level of exposure.
Ideally, neither children nor adults should have any mercury in their bodies because it provides no physiological benefit."" Yet, the FDA allows it to be put in flu shots given to pregnant women, children, and the elderly - all known to be most at risk for neurological damage, says Dr. Brownstein, editor of the newsletter Dr. David Brownstein's Natural Way to Health,
Thimerosal, a preservative found in many flu shots, is 50 percent mercury.
While the FDA warns against eating more than two servings of fish weekly because of the danger of mercury, it allows this more toxic form to be added to flu shots (and other vaccines).
Known as ethylmercury, this type of mercury in flu shots depresses the immune system and damages the brain.
Much of ethylmercury is converted in the body to a form of mercury that accumulates in the brain with every annual flu shot and is very difficult to remove.
Ethylmercury is much more harmful than methylmercury, the form of mercury found in fish, and is much more likely to stay in the brain.
""There's no doubt that the flu vaccine can lead to Alzheimer's, because many flu shots are preserved with mercury and it's a known brain toxin,"" says Dr. Brownstein.
One report by world-renowned immunogeneticist Dr. Hugh Fudenberg found that people 55 years of age and older who got a flu vaccine for five years straight increased their risk of Alzheimer's by 10 times.
""The flu vaccine has not been properly studied in pregnant women,"" says Dr. Brownstein.
no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women and FluLaval quadrivalent should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.'""
Not only can flu shots contain harmful ingredients but many experts, including Dr. Brownstein, believe they don't prevent flu.
""Those promoting flu shots promise they'll cut your risk of getting flu by more than 50 percent, but that's simply not true.
When you dissect the studies, you'll find the FluLaval vaccine is 97 percent ineffective.""
If you decide to take a flu shot, however, you can lessen your chances of harm by choosing a vaccine that doesn't contain mercury.
Since thimerosal is used only as a preservative in multi-dose vials, avoid it by asking for a single-dose vial.
If you decide not to take the flu shot, Dr. Brownstein suggests protecting yourself with the following steps:
3. Take vitamin C.
Vitamins A and D, iodine, and alpha lipoic acid are also helpful.

171,﻿snes-06359,- Some symptoms of a heart attack are subtle and can be mistaken for indigestion,"Is It Indigestion or Heart Attack?
Heartburn and heart attack pain can be similar, learn the difference
There is a burning sensation in your chest area.
Is it heartburn from indigestion?
Chest discomfort is the most common symptom of a heart attack, which can be life-threatening.
But it can also be a sign of heartburn, which has nothing to do with the heart and is a common symptom of indigestion.
Learning the difference can help you protect your heart health and know when to seek medical attention.
""If you're not sure if it's heartburn or a heart attack, and your chest pain is persistent seek medical help right away,"" says Kiyon Chung, MD, a Scripps cardiologist.
""You will be checked immediately to rule out a heart attack.
If your chest pain turns out to be a heart attack, doctors will work to lessen any heart damage.""
If it's indigestion, you'll want to make sure it doesn't become a chronic problem.
What is indigestion?
Heartburn is a symptom of indigestion or acid reflux.
It happens when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, the food pipe that connects the throat to the stomach.
This backflow causes a burning feeling or pain in the chest.
Another symptom is regurgitation, which is when food rises in the back of the throat.
Many foods can trigger indigestion, including spicy foods.
Other things you can do to prevent indigestion include cutting out alcohol, cigarettes, citrus, aspirin as well as eating close to bedtime or late at night.
Check with your doctor if you have recurring heartburn.
What is a heart attack?
What is a heart attack?
A heart attack occurs when an artery supplying the heart muscle with blood and oxygen is blocked.
It can be difficult to tell heartburn from a heart attack largely because the esophagus is near the heart.
Symptoms of heart attack
The type of chest discomfort in a heart attack is different than what is typically experienced with indigestion.
The classic symptoms of a heart attack are:
* Crushing pain or pressure in the center of the chest
People experiencing a heart attack may also experience sweating, toothache, headache, heartburn, nausea and vomiting.
Women and heart disease
Research shows that women can experience heart attacks differently than men.
A study in the scientific journal Circulation found only 30% of women had traditional chest pain symptoms.
Many had other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, weakness, cold sweat, nausea, upset stomach or back pain.
""Since heart attack symptoms can often seem vague in women, many may not realize when they're having a heart attack and miss the chance to seek immediate, life-saving medical attention,"" says Dr. Chung.
If you think you are having a heart attack, call 911 or have someone make the call for you immediately.
""The longer you delay treatment following the onset of symptoms, the greater the risk of damage to the heart and even death,"" Dr. Chung says.
""Don't brush off symptoms or wait to see if they get worse.
Seek medical care right away.""",narrative with details </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy </s> establishing legitimacy </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy,True,"- Some symptoms of a heart attack are subtle and can be mistaken for indigestion </s></s> Is It Indigestion or Heart Attack?

PUBLISHED: JUNE 8, 2016 6:15 PM EDT
UPDATED: JUNE 9, 2016 10:35 AM EDT
CAPE CORAL, Fla.- Seven children are fighting an aggressive skin infection their mothers say was contracted from playing in a rental bounce house at a birthday party.
""Every child that was in the bounce house has it,"" Alayna Sanchez said. ""It's very contagious and they are spreading all over their body.""
The birthday party full of fun and games turned into a nightmare for Stephanie Foraker's kids.
""The blisters were getting bigger,"" Foraker said, ""oozy...gross.""
Foraker claims the children got the infection Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from a rental bounce house.
Marybeth Saunders, medical director for infection prevention and epidemiology at Lee Memorial Health System, says MRSA is a painful bacterial infection.
""The bacteria gets into that area and can have a chance to multiply and cause an area of infection,"" Saunders explained, adding MRSA is usually spread through skin-to-skin contact.
Sanchez, who held the party in her backyard, said ""I feel horrible as a parent that all these children are in pain.""
She's now demanding a refund from the company she used to rent the bounce house.
""She wouldn't take responsibility for the staph infection,"" Sanchez said. ""I want a refund and an apology.""
But Yanney Rojas, the owner of Best Deal Party Rental, says she's not at fault, adding Sanchez signed the contract taking responsibility for the bounce house.
""I did my job. I put a bounce house on time, everything was fine with the bounce house. Why do you want me to return the money?"" Rojas said.
The Department of Health in Lee County said it's difficult to pinpoint where the kids contracted MRSA. Health officials say the kids may have spread it to each other or may have gotten it from the house, but that would require further investigation.
Medical professionals add the best way to avoid the bacteria is to make sure children wash their hands and cover cuts and scrapes.","narrative with details </s> narrative with details_details not verified </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility",True,"Kids Are Catching Staph Infections from Bounce Houses </s></s> Mothers claim children contracted skin infection from bounce house

""The bacteria gets into that area and can have a chance to multiply and cause an area of infection,"" Saunders explained, adding MRSA is usually spread through skin-to-skin contact.
Sanchez, who held the party in her backyard, said ""I feel horrible as a parent that all these children are in pain.""
She's now demanding a refund from the company she used to rent the bounce house.
""She wouldn't take responsibility for the staph infection,"" Sanchez said.
""I want a refund and an apology.""
But Yanney Rojas, the owner of Best Deal Party Rental, says she's not at fault, adding Sanchez signed the contract taking responsibility for the bounce house.
""I did my job.
Why do you want me to return the money?"" Rojas said.
The Department of Health in Lee County said it's difficult to pinpoint where the kids contracted MRSA.
Health officials say the kids may have spread it to each other or may have gotten it from the house, but that would require further investigation.
Medical professionals add the best way to avoid the bacteria is to make sure children wash their hands and cover cuts and scrapes. </s></s> narrative with details </s> lack of citation for evidence </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> religion or ideology </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> rhetorical tricks </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> politicizing health issues </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> politicizing health issues </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> politicizing health issues </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon"

Here are 6 interesting facts and benefits of tequila; we're talking about quality tequila, not that cheap stuff from the corner shop. Remember to drink responsibly and within your recommended weekly units.
1. <b> Tequila can help you lose weight <b> 
Tequila has a particular kind of sugar in it called agavins, which posses some weight-loss properties. The special molecular structure of agavins doesn't raise the blood sugar, meaning that many of the calories pass through the system unused, unlike other alcohol sugars, helping dissolve fats and stimulate the metabolism.
2. <b>  Helps with Digestion <b>
Because Teuila helps stimulate your metabolism, it helps with your digestion. Many communities have a shot of tequila before or after a meal to soothe and assist digestion.
3. <b> Tequila is a Probiotic <b>
Probiotics are healthy bacteria that are naturally occurring in the intestines. Responsible for our immune system and keeping a healthy balance in our bodies. Fructans, from which tequila is derived from, can help these good bacteria flourish. If you get drunk off tequila it will most likely have the opposite effect, but a small amount could help.
4. <b>  Tequila may help fight osteoporosis <b>
Agavins in tequila has been linked in several studies that help aid the body absorb calcium, which can be an option for preventing fragile or brittle bones.
5. <b>  Tequila may lower the chances of Dementia <b>
In this BBC report, they state that studies show a link between moderate alcohol drinkers and lower incidence of dementia later in life. The study also showed a correlation between people drinking too much alcohol and having a higher chance of dementia onset.
6. <b>  It doesn't give you a hangover. <b>
The decent, 100% agave tequila won't give you a hangover, whereas the cheaper brands will be full of other sugars that will most likely give you a hangover.

175,﻿tron-01414,A Warning that Pyrex Glass Cookware Can Explode,"Sylvia opened the oven door and the Pyrex dish had shattered into a million pieces.
I let everything cool down and then scrubbed the oven with Simple Green and some hot soapy water.
Upon completion I ran the oven empty to see if the temperature controller was working okay.
I suspected the oven got too hot and the dish simply blew.
The oven came up to temperature and cycled normally.
I Googled exploding Pyrex dishes and got ten million hits.
Exploding Pyrex is very common.
Here is the story.
A long, long time ago in a country we all know and love was a company named Corning.
They made Pryex dishes.
The Chinese discovered that using soda lime glass was almost as good as borosilicate glass and a lot cheaper.
Corning not only sold the technology to a company called World Kitchen, they also sold the rights to the original Pyrex logo.
Now it seems people are getting hurt using soda lime Pyrex.
Some dishes explode when they are lifted from the heating rack in the oven with devastating results.
World Kitchen is in denial.
Contrary to their denials the victims usually have more than one of these dishes and the Pryex logo is clearly visible.
If you buy a Pryex dish beware.
The label on the front says oven safe, freezer safe, microwave safe.
The instructions on the back tell another story.
You cannot move a soda lime Pyrex dish from the freezer to the oven and expect it to survive.
The fine print does on and on about what you are not allowed to do with the Pyrex dish.
The fine print has prevented World Kitchen from being sued because they have warned the consumer that their Pyrex dishes are junk from the get go.
And they are the same price as the original Corning dishes.
If you own borosilicate Pryex dishes no fear.
They have to be more than 25 years old to be sure they are indeed Corning dishes.
I am not sure if the old Pryex dishes have anything stamped in them that indicates they are made by Corning.
You may continue to use the soda lime dishes for holding stuff.
The reason the soda lime dishes let go is that over time they develop micro-cracks.
The liquid is like shoving a crowbar in the dish and pulling it apart.
Super heated liquids expand rapidly and it is the super heated liquids that force the soda lime glass to shatter into tens of thousands of shards.
Since Corning no longer makes Pyrex and Sylvia proudly holds a large collection of the soda lime Pyrex, we decided that one bomb in the kitchen is enough.
The Pyrex dishes will go bye-bye in this week's trash.
I do not know what we will use for cake and pie dishes going forward.
I strongly urge you not to use the soda lime Pyrex for the oven, stovetop or microwave.
As to World Kitchen: them and their cheap dishes.

177,﻿snes-01852,"Johns Hopkins Scientist Exposes Flu Vaccine Danger?
Original","Peter Doshi, Ph.D., charges that although the vaccines are being pushed on the public in unprecedented numbers, they are less effective and cause more side effects than alleged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Further, says Doshi, the studies that underlie the CDC's policy of encouraging most people to get a yearly flu shot are often low quality studies that do not substantiate the official claims.
Promoting influenza vaccines is one of the most visible and aggressive public health policies in the United States, says Doshi of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
Only 20 years ago, 32 million doses of influenza vaccine were available in the United States on an annual basis.
""The vaccine may be less beneficial and less safe than has been claimed, and the threat of influenza seems to be overstated,"" Doshi says.
The main assertion of the CDC that fuels the push for flu vaccines each year is that influenza comes with a risk of serious complications which can cause death, especially in senior citizens and those suffering from chronic illnesses.
The only randomized trial of influenza vaccine in older people found no decrease in deaths.
""This means that influenza vaccines are approved for use in older people despite any clinical trials demonstrating a reduction in serious outcomes,"" says Doshi.
Even when the vaccine is closely matched to the type of influenza that's prevalent, which doesn't happen every year, randomized, controlled trials of healthy adults found that vaccinating between 33 and 100 people resulted in one less case of influenza.
In addition, says Doshi, no evidence exists to show that this reduction in the risk of influenza for a specific population - here in the United States, among healthy adults, for example - extrapolates into any reduced risk of serious complications from influenza, such as hospitalizations or deaths, among seniors.
""For most people, and possibly most doctors, officials need only claim that vaccines save lives, and it is assumed there must be solid research behind it,"" says Doshi.
Although the CDC  implies that flu vaccines are safe and there's no need to weigh benefits against risk, Doshi disagrees.
What's even worse is that small children who are given the flu vaccine get no protection from the disease.
""The government also says that every baby over the age of six months should have a vaccine, and they know it contains a dose of mercury that is toxic to the brain,"" says Dr. Blaylock.
""They also know the studies have shown that the flu vaccine has zero - zero - effectiveness in children under five.""
For most people, says Dr. Blaylock, flu vaccines don't prevent the flu but actually increase the odds of getting it.
One study found that those who get the flu vaccine for three to five years increase their risk of Alzheimer's disease 10-fold.
Why do drug companies push the flu vaccine?

181,﻿tron-01842,Four-year old girl intoxicated from hand sanitizer,"More children getting drunk on hand sanitizer
AtlantaCNN — 
Six-year-old Nhaijah Russell swallowed three or four squirts of seemingly innocuous liquid hand sanitizer at school.
It tasted good, she said, like strawberry.
It also contained enough alcohol to make her dangerously drunk.
She arrived at the emergency room slurring her words and unable to walk.
Is hand sanitizer toxic?
Since 2010, poison control center hotlines across the United States have seen a nearly 400% increase in calls related to children younger than 12 ingesting hand sanitizer, according to new analysis by the Georgia Poison Center.

Common household poisons
“Kids are getting into these products more frequently, and unfortunately, there’s a percentage of them going to the emergency room,” said Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the center’s director.
The amount of alcohol in hand sanitizer ranges from 45% to 95%.
Ingesting even small amounts – as little as two or three squirts in some cases – can cause alcohol poisoning.

Hand sanitizer doesn’t help in schools
Nhaijah’s blood-alcohol level was .179, twice what’s considered legally drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, who treated her in the emergency room at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Doctors had to watch Nhaijah overnight at a nearby children’s hospital for signs of brain trauma, since the alcohol had caused her to fall and hit her head, he said.
“That was very scary,” Nhaijah’s mother, Ortoria Scott, said.
“It could have been very lethal for my child.”
Alcohol poisoning can cause confusion, vomiting and drowsiness.
In severe cases, a child can stop breathing.
Lopez said 3,266 hand sanitizer cases related to young children were reported to poison control centers in 2010.
In 2014, the number increased to 16,117 cases.
Last week, Lopez sent a letter to Georgia’s school systems warning about children drinking hand sanitizer.
He explained that some children do it intentionally in order to get drunk, while others do it on a dare from friends.
Still others, he said, drink sanitizer because it looks tasty.
“A kid is not thinking this is bad for them,” Lopez said.
“A lot of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented.
There are strawberry, grape, orange-flavored hand sanitizers that are very appealing to kids.”
Lopez recommends parents and teachers store hand sanitizer out of reach of children and monitor its use.

Six-year-old Nhaijah Russell swallowed three or four squirts of seemingly innocuous liquid hand sanitizer at school.
It also contained enough alcohol to make her dangerously drunk.
Since 2010, poison control center hotlines across the United States have seen a nearly 400% increase in calls related to children younger than 12 ingesting hand sanitizer, according to new analysis by the Georgia Poison Center.
“Kids are getting into these products more frequently, and unfortunately, there’s a percentage of them going to the emergency room,” said Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the center’s director.
The amount of alcohol in hand sanitizer ranges from 45% to 95%.
Ingesting even small amounts – as little as two or three squirts in some cases – can cause alcohol poisoning.

AtlantaCNN — 
Six-year-old Nhaijah Russell swallowed three or four squirts of seemingly innocuous liquid hand sanitizer at school.
It tasted good, she said, like strawberry.
It also contained enough alcohol to make her dangerously drunk.
She arrived at the emergency room slurring her words and unable to walk.
Is hand sanitizer toxic?

Some of you might not be parents, but you may have nieces, nephews, grandchildren or friends with children this will pertain to you too.
As I read the following, my heart sank.
I urge each and every one of you to pass this on to as many people as you can.
I cannot stress how important this is!
This is very disturbing news.
In addition to the following true story, I will also add that my own sons were playing in the ball pit at Discovery Zone one day.
One son lost his watch, and was very upset.
We dug and dug in those balls, trying to find the watch.
Instead, we found vomit, food, faeces, and other stuff I do not want to discuss.
I went to the manager and raised heck.
Came to find out, the ball pit is only cleaned out once a month.
I have doubts that it is even done that often.
My kids will never play in another ball pit.

Hi, My name is Lauren Archer, my son Kevin and I lived in Sugarland, TX.
On October 2nd, 1994 I took my only son to McDonald's for his 3rd birthday.
After he finished lunch, I allowed him to play in the ball pit.
When he started whining later on, I asked him what was wrong, he pointed to the back of his pull-up and simply said ""Mommy, it hurts."" But I couldn't find anything wrong with him at that time.
I bathed him when we got home, and it was at that point when I found a welt on his left buttock.
Upon investigating, it seemed as if there was something like a splinter under the welt.
I made an appointment to have it taken out the next day, but soon he started vomiting and shaking, then his eyes rolled back into his head.
From there, we went to the emergency room.
He died later that night.
It turned out that the welt on his buttock was the tip of a hypodermic needle that had broken off inside.
The autopsy revealed that Kevin had died from heroine overdose.
The next week, the police removed the balls from the ball pit and lo and behold.
There was rotten food, several hypodermic needles: some full; some used; knives, half-eaten candy, diapers, feces, and the stench of urine.
If a child is not safe in a child's play area then where?

Don't Go About Kissing Everyone; New HPV Virus That Kills Faster Than HIV/AIDS Erupts.

Students from Kisii University, Kenya and the general public at large have been warned against kissing carelessly due to an outbreak of Human papilloma virus, which has seen several people admitted at Kisii level 5 hospital after testing positive to the disease.
HPV is an infectious viral disease which cause mouth cancer and is transmitted through infected body fluids and that's why people have been warned against kissing any how they want.
The symptoms include sore throat, severe headache, High fever, Vomit and abdominal pains.
 
""We were told that public health officers from this area are working round the clock to know the root cause of this. But we are being advised even on WhatsApp groups to avoid kissing and exchanging body fluids,"" A third year public health student from Kisii University lamented.
The HPV is gradually circulating Kenya and gradually making its way into the Southern parts of Africa and will soon hit Africa at large.
Africans are believed to travel a lot to all parts of the world. So if proper awareness is not created, this is likely to hit the whole world in no distance time.
You are hereby advised to warn and inform family members, friends, well wishers and colleagues about this deadly disease that kills faster than HIV/AIDS.

You are hereby advised to warn and inform family members, friends, well wishers and colleagues about this deadly disease that kills faster than HIV/AIDS.

187,﻿snes-06005,"Gelatin is made from the bones, hides, and other parts of animals, including horses.","What is Jell-O?
By Michael Dhar published December 19, 2013
Jell-O is made of gelatin, sweetener, and artificial flavorings.
Jell-O is a sweetened gelatin product made by boiling the bones and hides of animals.
(Image credit: Shutterstock)
It's brightly-colored, jiggly and a mainstay of dinner tables and frat parties everywhere in America.
It's Jell-O, a dessert that's been sold since 1897 .
But anyone whose chewed on that weirdly squishy confection has wondered: what exactly is Jell-O?
And why does it have that distinctive texture?
Technically, ""Jell-O"" is actually a brand name, currently owned by Kraft Heinz, that is used to market a range of desserts and snacks.
But most people use the term to refer to the gelatin-based desserts that are also sold under the ""Jell-O"" name.
The jiggly red dessert we think of as Jell-O is made up of almost 90% sugar, although the key ingredient that gives Jell-O its distinctive consistency is gelatin.
(The dessert also contains artificial colors, sweeteners and other flavorings, such as strawberry, orange and lime.)
Gelatin itself is a collection of long, stringy animal-based proteins called collagen, which bond together in three-stranded helical structures - similar to the two-stranded helices of DNA.
It is created by cooking that collagen, according to Healthline(opens in new tab).
Urban legends claim that gelatin comes from horse or cow hooves, though that's not the case.
The collagen in gelatin does come from boiling the bones and hides of animals processed for their meat (usually cows and pigs(opens in new tab)).
But hooves consist of a different protein, keratin(opens in new tab), which can't produce gelatin.
To make Jell-O, you need to heat the gelatin in water.
Heating breaks the bonds holding the collagen together.
Next, the heated water-gelatin solution must be cooled, allowing the collagen strands to rebond in a network, but if it's cooled with the right timing, water molecules will get trapped inside this collagen-network, Scientific American reported(opens in new tab).
The collagen network gives Jell-O its semisolid properties, while the trapped water keeps it jiggly.

By Michael Dhar published December 19, 2013
Jell-O is made of gelatin, sweetener, and artificial flavorings.
Jell-O is a sweetened gelatin product made by boiling the bones and hides of animals.

It's brightly-colored, jiggly and a mainstay of dinner tables and frat parties everywhere in America.
It's Jell-O, a dessert that's been sold since 1897 .
But anyone whose chewed on that weirdly squishy confection has wondered: what exactly is Jell-O?
And why does it have that distinctive texture?
Technically, ""Jell-O"" is actually a brand name, currently owned by Kraft Heinz, that is used to market a range of desserts and snacks.
But most people use the term to refer to the gelatin-based desserts that are also sold under the ""Jell-O"" name.
The jiggly red dessert we think of as Jell-O is made up of almost 90% sugar, although the key ingredient that gives Jell-O its distinctive consistency is gelatin.
(The dessert also contains artificial colors, sweeteners and other flavorings, such as strawberry, orange and lime.)
Gelatin itself is a collection of long, stringy animal-based proteins called collagen, which bond together in three-stranded helical structures - similar to the two-stranded helices of DNA.
It is created by cooking that collagen, according to Healthline(opens in new tab).
Urban legends claim that gelatin comes from horse or cow hooves, though that's not the case.
The collagen in gelatin does come from boiling the bones and hides of animals processed for their meat (usually cows and pigs(opens in new tab)).
But hooves consist of a different protein, keratin(opens in new tab), which can't produce gelatin.
To make Jell-O, you need to heat the gelatin in water.
Heating breaks the bonds holding the collagen together.
Next, the heated water-gelatin solution must be cooled, allowing the collagen strands to rebond in a network, but if it's cooled with the right timing, water molecules will get trapped inside this collagen-network, Scientific American reported(opens in new tab).

admin April 15, 2016 Italian doctor may have found surprisingly simple cure for Multiple Sclerosis2016-04-23T18:58:25+00:00multiple sclerosis
An Italian doctor has been getting dramatic results with a new type of treatment for Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, which affects up to 2.5 million people worldwide.
In an initial study, Dr. Paolo Zamboni took 65 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, performed a simple operation to unblock restricted bloodflow out of the brain - and two years after the surgery, 73% of the patients had no symptoms.
Dr. Zamboni's thinking could turn the current understanding of MS on its head, and offer many sufferers a complete cure.
It's generally accepted that there's no cure for MS, only treatments that mitigate the symptoms - but a new way of looking at the disease has opened the door to a simple treatment that is causing radical improvements in a small sample of sufferers.
Italian Dr. Paolo Zamboni has put forward the idea that many types of MS are actually caused by a blockage of the pathways that remove excess iron from the brain - and by simply clearing out a couple of major veins to reopen the blood flow, the root cause of the disease can be eliminated.
More than 90% of people with MS have some sort of malformation or blockage in the veins that drain blood from the brain.
He formed a hypothesis on how this could lead to MS: iron builds up in the brain, blocking and damaging these crucial blood vessels.
As the vessels rupture, they allow both the iron itself, and immune cells from the bloodstream, to cross the blood-brain barrier into the cerebro-spinal fluid.
Zamboni immediately scheduled his wife for a simple operation to unblock the veins - a catheter was threaded up through blood vessels in the groin area, all the way up to the effected area, and then a small balloon was inflated to clear out the blockage.
In the three years since the surgery, Dr. Zamboni's wife has not had an attack.
Widening out his study, Dr. Zamboni then tried the same operation on a group of 65 MS-sufferers, identifying blood drainage blockages in the brain and unblocking them - and more than 73% of the patients are completely free of the symptoms of MS, two years after the operation.
Still, most agree that while further study needs to be undertaken before this is looked upon as a cure for MS, the results thus far have been very positive.
Naturally, support groups for MS sufferers are buzzing with the news that a simple operation could free patients from what they have always been told would be a lifelong affliction, and further studies are being undertaken by researchers around the world hoping to confirm the link between CCSVI and MS, and open the door for the treatment to become available for sufferers worldwide.
It's certainly a very exciting find for MS sufferers, as it represents a possible complete cure, as opposed to an ongoing treatment of symptoms.",distinctive linguistic features </s> title of article as clickbait </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> rhetorical tricks </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> less robust evidence or outdated evidence_verified </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to not be credible in this context </s> hope </s> emotional appeals </s> narrative with details </s> narrative with details_details not verified </s> narrative with details </s> narrative with details_details not verified </s> narrative with details </s> narrative with details_details not verified </s> narrative with details_details not verified </s> narrative with details </s> emotional appeals </s> hope,False,"An Italian doctor uncovered a surprisingly simple cure for multiple sclerosis in April 2016. </s></s> Italian doctor may have found surprisingly simple cure for Multiple Sclerosis

190,﻿snes-04304,A 12-year-old Wisconsin girl in died as a result of receiving the Gardasil HPV vaccine,"The sudden death of a 12-year-old girl in Waukesha, Wisconsin, just hours after receiving the HPV Gardasil vaccine has shocked the girl's family, and sent local media out asking questions as to how this could happen.
Dr. Geoffrey Swain of the local health department was interviewed to give the standard CDC reply, which is similar to almost every other vaccine, stating that severe reactions like this resulting in death are ""very rare,"" and about ""1 out of a million"".
Assuming that there is some data to back up the claim of only ""1 out of a million,"" how many doses of the HPV vaccine are administered every year?
According to the latest statistics (July 2014) published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services here (page 7), over 9 million per year.
So the government admits that at least 9 girls per year are killed by the HPV vaccine.
But here are some other facts regarding the vaccine that they failed to disclose, probably because they did not take the time to look outside of the standard government response to events like this, or their station managers did not allow them to give any other news outside of what the CDC claims.
1. There are many more reported side effects than just death from the HPV vaccine.
* Dr. Deirdre Little, a pediatrician in Australia, was the first one to sound the alarm over the HPV vaccine causing premature menopause when she observed it in one of her 16 year old patients in 2012.
* Supreme Court in India to Rule on Merck Fraud Regarding HPV Vaccine Deaths
* 10 More Young Women File Criminal Complaints due to Injuries from Gardasil Vaccine in France
4. The U.S. Government Earns Royalties from the sale of the Gardasil HPV Vaccine.
Dr. Eric Suba tried to use the Freedom of Information Act to find out how much money the National Institute of Health (NIH) earned from the sale of Gardasil, but they refused to report the amount of revenue the government earns from this vaccine (although not denying they do earn royalties).
Did you know that the government earns royalties from the sale of the Gardasil vaccine?
Does your doctor promoting the HPV vaccine know this?
5. Julie Gerberding was in charge of the CDC the years the FDA approved Gardasil as a vaccine and is now the president of Merck's Vaccine division, a $5 billion dollar a year operation
Julie Gerberding was in charge of the CDC from 2002 to 2009, which includes the years the FDA approved Gardasil as a vaccine.
Scientists at the Duke University School of Medicine discovered that African American women carry HPV strains not found in the Gardasil vaccine.
Moshella Roberts, a 20-year-old African American woman died needlessly from the HPV vaccine.
While it is encouraging to see local news affiliates report deaths and injuries due to the Gardasil vaccine, they need to do more research to present all of the facts, rather than just parroting what the CDC says.
In the meantime, do your own research before making any decisions on the Gardasil vaccine!",title of article as clickbait </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> narrative with details </s> narrative with details_details verified to be true </s> exploiting science’s limitations </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> claims without evidence </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> emotional appeals </s> anger </s> narrative with details </s> narrative with details_details not verified </s> rhetorical tricks </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> establishing legitimacy </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> establishing legitimacy </s> emotional appeals </s> anger </s> fear </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> financial motivation </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> financial motivation </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> establishing legitimacy </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> financial motivation </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> narrative with details_details not verified </s> narrative with details </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> emotional appeals </s> anger </s> call to action </s> establishing legitimacy,False,"A 12-year-old Wisconsin girl in died as a result of receiving the Gardasil HPV vaccine </s></s> The sudden death of a 12-year-old girl in Waukesha, Wisconsin, just hours after receiving the HPV Gardasil vaccine has shocked the girl's family, and sent local media out asking questions as to how this could happen.
Dr. Geoffrey Swain of the local health department was interviewed to give the standard CDC reply, which is similar to almost every other vaccine, stating that severe reactions like this resulting in death are ""very rare,"" and about ""1 out of a million"".
According to the latest statistics (July 2014) published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services here (page 7), over 9 million per year.
So the government admits that at least 9 girls per year are killed by the HPV vaccine.
1. There are many more reported side effects than just death from the HPV vaccine.
* Dr. Deirdre Little, a pediatrician in Australia, was the first one to sound the alarm over the HPV vaccine causing premature menopause when she observed it in one of her 16 year old patients in 2012.

193,﻿snes-04082,You should avoid eating green potatoes because they are poisonous.,"The Claim: Green Potatoes Are Poisonous
By Anahad O'Connor
* July 3, 2007
<b> THE FACTS <b>
It sounds like a joke, or perhaps just an urban legend that grew out of Dr. Seuss's ""Green Eggs and Ham."" But food scientists say this one is no myth. The reality is that green potatoes contain high levels of a toxin, solanine, which can cause nausea, headaches and neurological problems.
Potatoes naturally produce small amounts of solanine as a defense against insects, but the levels increase with prolonged exposure to light and warm temperatures.
The green color is actually caused by high levels of chlorophyll, which by itself is harmless. But it is also a sign that levels of solanine, which is produced at the same time as chlorophyll, have increased as well.
According to a recent report by Alexander Pavlista, a professor of agronomy and horticulture at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, a 100-pound person would have to eat about 16 ounces of a fully green potato to get sick. That is the weight of a large baked potato.
The report noted that most green potatoes never reach the market. Still, to avoid the development of solanine, it is best to store potatoes in cool, dimly lit areas, and to cut away green areas before eating.
Another good rule: if it tastes bitter, don't eat it. Unlike Dr. Seuss's entree, this green meal would not have a happy ending.
