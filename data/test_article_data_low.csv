There are many signs and symptoms of breast cancer, although some of them aren't very well known.
You may not have pictured any of these scenarios; instead, you may have immediately thought about the discovery of a palpable lump in breast tissue.
And while breast lumps are very common warning signs of possible cancer, they are not the only ones.
There are several less-known warning signs of a possibility of breast disease.
When it comes to breast cancer awareness, knowledge is power and the more we know, the better prepared we can be for the future.
Before we begin talking about the signs and symptoms of breast cancer, may I ask you a question?
As you view your chest area, look at the size of your breasts.
The important thing is to really pay attention to how your breasts look.
Now, let's discuss the less common signs that could indicate a possibility of breast cancer.
One of the first and most commonly overlooked signs is a slight puckering of the breast.
If you notice any puckering, no matter how slight, you need to see your doctor and have this area checked.
The puckering may be near the nipple, along the sides of your breasts, or anywhere along your breast tissue.
As a tumor in the breast begins to grow, it can sometimes disrupt the architecture of the skin and cause a pulling of tissues and ligaments.
Along with puckering, another possible sign of breast cancer is breast dimpling.
There may be slight pitting or dimples along the breast tissue.
If you notice any such areas, please have them checked as soon as possible.
Another less common sign of possible breast cancer involves the nipple.
Breast cancer can invade nipple tissue causing variations in texture, appearance, or color.
Another less known sign of breast cancer can be breast pain.
If you notice a particular area of your breast that hurts, like a deep, inner throbbing, have your doctor evaluate it as soon as possible.
Red spots on the skin of the breast can also be warning signs of a problem.
Although this sign is often disregarded, it can be a very subtle warning signal of a very dangerous type of breast cancer.
Red areas on the breast tissue can warn of inflammatory breast cancer.
If your breast becomes warm, red, swollen, or if you notice your breast tissues has thickened, please get checked.
Now that you know some of the lesser known symptoms of breast cancer, please be sure and check your breasts on a regular basis.
Along with these symptoms, please remember, in your exams, to pay particular attention to any lumps, masses or areas of hard tissue you come across.
While these tests are vitally important, the majority of breast cancers are found by women who are diligent to check their bodies.
In the event you notice any of the symptoms described in this article, don't instantly become fearful and assume you have breast cancer but do see a doctor as soon as possible.",legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> establishing legitimacy </s> emotional appeals </s> fear </s> emotional appeals </s> anxiety,true,"Warning About Inflammatory Breast Cancer </s></s> Lesser-Known Symptoms of Breast Cancer

3,﻿tron-02266,Beezing Trend Among Teens,"'Beezing' trend swarming through CHS student body
By Noah Salzberg, Online Features Editor
April 30, 2014
A new phenomenon has spread through the halls of CHS like wildfire, and this new trend is unlike many others.
Simply put, it involves Burt's Bees Peppermint lip balm.
""Beezing,"" as it is called, is to spread Burt's Bees peppermint lip balm on one's eyelids to obtain a weird yet enticing sensation.
""When you beeze, it's like your eyes are eating a York peppermint patty,"" senior Dilan Hettiarachchi said.
""There is just this cool, minty sensation on your eyelids.""
With its unknown origin, Beezing is a trend not only at CHS, but also around the country, with stories of Beezing coming from the states of New Jersey and New York.
Nevertheless, it is quickly spreading throughout the CHS population.
""I found out about beezing from my friends on cross country,"" junior Eric Murray said.
""I now beeze twice a week.""
The usage of the words ""beezing"" and ""stung""-a word that describes the state after which you have applied the lip balm to the eyelids- may make beezing sound unhealthy and dangerous.
This, however, is completely contrary to the truth.
There is no health effect; the only effect of beezing is the sensation on the eyelids.
According to a Burt's Bees representative, Burt's Bees ""does not make any claims about putting the lip balm on the eyelids.""
""There is no downside to beezing,"" Murray said.
""The only effect is the cool, minty sensation on the eyelids.""
The common perception about beezing is that the minty, burning feeling on the eyelids helps keep the person alert and focused.
""I beeze to stay awake,"" senior Nikhil Perincherry said.
""It helps me to stay alert and always be on my 'A' game.""
As with all trends, many students in the CHS community are opposed to beezing because they perceive it as unsophisticated.
""The premise of beezing is one that appears to be very dumb since it is not something that you usually see,"" junior Olivia Shannon said.
However, many opponents of the fad find no reason for people not to try beezing other than the possibility of looking strange while doing it.
""It is something people should try at least once to experience,"" Shannon said.
""It is a very interesting feeling.""
Whether or not beezing is just another fad to come and go through the halls of CHS is a mystery, but its legacy is one that will leave an impact on the students who have tried it.

They have no beaks, no feathers, and no feet.
Their bone structure is dramatically shrunk to get more meat out of them.
This is great for KFC.
Because they do not have to pay so much for their production costs.
There is no more plucking of the feathers or the removal of the beaks and feet.
The government has told them to change all of their menus so they do not say chicken anywhere.
If you look closely you will notice this.
Listen to their commercials, I guarantee you will not see or hear the word chicken.
I find this matter to be very disturbing.

7,﻿snes-03921,Dandelion root can kill 98 percent of cancer cells in 48 hours,"Scientists Find Root That Kills 98% Of Cancer Cells In Only 48 Hours
Dandelion has been used medicinally since ancient times for its various health benefits.
This potent root builds up blood and immune system- cures prostate, lung, and other cancers better than chemotherapy.
According to Dr. Carolyn Hamm from the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre in Ontario, Canada, dandelion root extract was the only thing that helped with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
John Di Carlo, who at the time was a 72-year old cancer patient at the hospital, was sent home to live out his final days after all efforts failed to treat his leukemia.
He told CBC News that he was advised to drink dandelion root tea as a last ditch effort.
His doctors attributed this to the dandelion tea that he drank.
Recent studies have shown that dandelion root extract can work very quickly on cancer cells, as was evidenced in Di Carlo's case.
Within 48 hours of coming into contact with the extract, cancerous cells begin to disintegrate.
The body happily replaces these with healthy new cells.
Further studies have concluded that the extract also has anti-cancer benefits for other types of cancer, including breast, colon, prostate, liver, and lung cancer!
Dandelion root tea may not taste as pleasant as other teas, but it's certainly more pleasant than living with the side effects of chemotherapy or radiation treatments.
Traditional cancer therapies harm the immune system by killing all cells, even the healthy ones.
Dandelion root has the opposite effect - it actually helps boost your immune system and only targets the unhealthy cells.
Dr. Hamm warns, however, that dandelion root extract can negatively impact the effects of chemotherapy.
Even if you don't have cancer, eating the greens or drinking dandelion tea can still give you great health!
For example, the roots and stems of dandelion can help fight diabetes.
If you suffer from digestive issues or need to get rid of toxins, dandelion tea may be just what the herbal medicine doctor ordered!
The liver aids the digestive system by producing bile, and it also filters the blood of chemicals and other impurities.
According to Dr. Axe, the vitamins and minerals found in dandelions can help cleanse the liver and keep it in tip top shape.
So by supporting your liver, you are actually creating better health!
Dandelions are also high in antioxidants and vitamin C, which is crucial to helping your body fight off infections, such as the bacteria that cause urinary tract infections.
If you suffer from frequent bouts of UTI, drinking dandelion tea on a daily basis may prevent it from happening ever again.
Dandelion greens are bitter, but completely edible - as long as you get it from an area that hasn't been sprayed with chemicals.
The greens are rich in fiber, which is great for intestinal health!
The greens are also high in vitamin A - just one cup contains 100% of your recommended daily allowance.

A Melbourne teenager has been left with dozens of tiny bites on his feet and legs that wouldn't stop bleeding, after simply wading in the ocean.
Sam Kanizay, 16, was soaking his legs in the water at Dendy Street Beach in Brighton, Melbourne, on Saturday evening when he said he felt his legs tingling.
He told Fairfax Media he presumed it was because his legs were sore from playing football and the water was cold.
But after coming out of the water about 30 minutes later, he found his legs were covered in tiny sores which were oozing with blood.

What are sea lice?
Sea lice which cause tiny, pin-prick like bites are a miniscule jellyfish or stinger larvae.
They have the same stinging cells as an adult jellyfish, though they can only attack a small area because of their size

LUCENTIUSGETTY IMAGES
Brits are being urged to take extra care around 'Britain's most dangerous plant', giant hogweed.
Prevalent at this time of year, the toxic flowering plant has been causing horrendous blistering burns on both adults and children.
While giant hogweed usually grows near waterways, experts have explained they are losing a battle to eradicate its presence, after homeowners have spotted the plant popping up in their parks and gardens.
It might look harmless, but this invasive plant harbours toxic sap on its stems - and can be extremely dangerous when it comes into contact with bare skin.
Over in Bolton, one primary school girl suffered second-degree burns after touching the plant while playing in a park.
Meanwhile, one man in Cornwall was left unable to walk after feeling like he was ""on fire"" after coming into contact with the plant.
With the weather warming up, experts have expressed new fears that giant hogweed will spread further.
One Facebook post read: ""Now is the season for 'Britain's most dangerous plant' and with the lovely weather forecast in a couple of weeks time, this stuff will thrive and spread.
""Any parts of the body that come into contact with the sap of a giant hogweed should be immediately washed with soap and cold water and seek medical advice.
This content is imported from Facebook.
Guy Barter, chief horticulturist at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), previously told The Times that flooding has meant the plant's seeds have spread to previously untouched areas.
He also warned people to take extra care if they have spotted it growing: ""It can cause some very nasty injuries which take a long time to heal.
It can cause some very nasty injuries which take a long time to heal.""
Giant hogweed was first introduced to the UK in the 1980s as an ornamental plant, but quickly spread across the country.
It is also very invasive, over-powering other flowers in the same area and reducing wildlife, too.
What happens if you touch the plant?
It's a flowering plant in the same family as carrots.
Giant hogweed typically grows to a height of around two to five metres.
Serious reactions to the skin are caused by 'furocoumarin derivatives' in its stems, leaves, roots and seeds.
It can lead to skin inflammation and blisters, with a reaction to the plant happening around 15 minutes after first coming into contact with it.
Children should take extra care, especially when playing outside in overgrown areas.
It can easily be mistaken as a harmless plant, so young children can unknowingly pick the flowering heads without realising.
More serious cases include people having long-term sensitivity to sunlight after touching the plant, as well as blindness if it comes into contact with the eyes.
As well as growing wild in the countryside, it is also known to flower in gardens if they are left unkept.
Keep an eye open when out on walks to ensure young children and dogs don't come into contact with the plant.",narrative with details_details verified to be true </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> establishing legitimacy </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk,true,"The sap of the giant hogweed plant can cause severe skin and eye irritation. </s></s> Giant hogweed warning after child suffers second-degree burns touching plant

Brits are being urged to take extra care around 'Britain's most dangerous plant', giant hogweed.
Prevalent at this time of year, the toxic flowering plant has been causing horrendous blistering burns on both adults and children.
While giant hogweed usually grows near waterways, experts have explained they are losing a battle to eradicate its presence, after homeowners have spotted the plant popping up in their parks and gardens.
It might look harmless, but this invasive plant harbours toxic sap on its stems - and can be extremely dangerous when it comes into contact with bare skin.
Over in Bolton, one primary school girl suffered second-degree burns after touching the plant while playing in a park.
Meanwhile, one man in Cornwall was left unable to walk after feeling like he was ""on fire"" after coming into contact with the plant.
With the weather warming up, experts have expressed new fears that giant hogweed will spread further.
One Facebook post read: ""Now is the season for 'Britain's most dangerous plant' and with the lovely weather forecast in a couple of weeks time, this stuff will thrive and spread.
""Any parts of the body that come into contact with the sap of a giant hogweed should be immediately washed with soap and cold water and seek medical advice.
Guy Barter, chief horticulturist at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), previously told The Times that flooding has meant the plant's seeds have spread to previously untouched areas.
He also warned people to take extra care if they have spotted it growing: ""It can cause some very nasty injuries which take a long time to heal.

Giant hogweed was first introduced to the UK in the 1980s as an ornamental plant, but quickly spread across the country.
Giant hogweed typically grows to a height of around two to five metres.
Serious reactions to the skin are caused by 'furocoumarin derivatives' in its stems, leaves, roots and seeds.
It can lead to skin inflammation and blisters, with a reaction to the plant happening around 15 minutes after first coming into contact with it.
Children should take extra care, especially when playing outside in overgrown areas.
It can easily be mistaken as a harmless plant, so young children can unknowingly pick the flowering heads without realising.
More serious cases include people having long-term sensitivity to sunlight after touching the plant, as well as blindness if it comes into contact with the eyes.

Researchers at the University of Alberta, in Edmonton, Canada have cured cancer last week, yet there is a little ripple in the news or in TV.
It is a simple technique using very basic drug.
The method employs dichloroacetate, which is currently used to treat metabolic disorders.
So, there is no concern of side effects or about their long term effects.
This drug doesn't require a patent, so anyone can employ it widely and cheaply compared to the costly cancer drugs produced by major pharmaceutical companies.
Canadian scientists tested this dichloroacetate (DCA) on human's cells; it killed lung, breast and brain cancer cells and left the healthy cells alone.
It was tested on Rats inflicted with severe tumors; their cells shrank when they were fed with water supplemented with DCA.
The drug is widely available and the technique is easy to use, why the major drug companies are not involved?
Or the Media interested in this find?
In human bodies there is a natural cancer fighting human cell, the mitochondria, but they need to be triggered to be effective.
Scientists used to think that these mitochondria cells were damaged and thus ineffective against cancer.
So they used to focus on glycolysis, which is less effective in curing cancer and more wasteful.
The drug manufacturers focused on this glycolysis method to fight cancer.
This DCA on the other hand doesn't rely on glycolysis instead on mitochondria; it triggers the mitochondria which in turn fights the cancer cells.
The side effect of this is it also reactivates a process called apoptosis.
You see, mitochondria contain an all-too-important self-destruct button that can't be pressed in cancer cells.
Without it, tumors grow larger as cells refuse to be extinguished.
Fully functioning mitochondria, thanks to DCA, can once again die.
With glycolysis turned off, the body produces less lactic acid, so the bad tissue around cancer cells doesn't break down and seed new tumors.
Pharmaceutical companies are not investing in this research because DCA method cannot be patented, without a patent they can't make money, like they are doing now with their AIDS Patent.
Since the pharmaceutical companies won't develop this, the article says other independent laboratories should start producing this drug and do more research to confirm all the above findings and produce drugs.

Research Reveals E-Cigs Have 10 Times More Cancer Causing Ingredients Than Cigarettes
Eyfusing 
New research has found electronic cigarettes to contain even 10 times more cancer causing ingredients than the tobacco products they are supposed to save us from.
Quite an astonishing revelation given E-cigarettes are meant to replace a dangerous and life destroying habit.
E-cigarettes are used by millions of people worldwide, all with the belief that they are a safer alternative to tobacco products.
However, according to research conducted by Japanese scientists, e-cigarettes contain 10 times the level of cancer-causing carcinogens than regular cigarettes.
In the research commissioned by the Japanese Ministry of Health, it was found that formaldehyde and acetaldehyde carcinogens are present, and prevalent, in the liquid produced by many e-cigarette products.
Furthermore, it was determined that e-cigarettes can fuel potentially life-threatening drug-resistant pathogens.
This discovery comes from a lab study that tested the vapor from e-cigarettes on live methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and human cells.
According to a Japanese Ministry of Health official, the formaldehyde carcinogen is much more present in the e-cigarette liquids than in the chemicals used in regular cigarettes.
""In one brand of e-cigarette the team found more than 10 times the level of carcinogens contained in one regular cigarette.
Especially when the wire (which vaporizes the liquid) gets overheated, higher amounts of those harmful substances seemed to be produced"", said researcher Naoki Kunugita.
Kunugita also added that the levels of the formaldehyde carcinogen varied in the final results.
""You call them e-cigarettes, but they are products totally different from regular tobacco.
The government is now studying the possible risks associated with them, with view to looking at how they should be regulated.""
In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) advised governments to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to underage people because they posed potentially serious health risks.
The UN health agency said that although there's a lack of evidence regarding the damage caused by e-cigarettes, there's still enough evidence ""to caution children and adolescents, pregnant women, and women of reproductive age"" about their use.
According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) more than a quarter of a million youth who had never smoked a cigarette used electronic cigarettes in 2013.
This number reflects a three-fold increase, from about 79,000 in 2011, to more than 263,000 in 2013.

Both types of cancer are diagnosed in the same way (with the ""tumor marker"" CA-125 blood test), and they are treated in the same way (surgery to remove the primary tumor and then chemotherapy with Taxol and Carboplatin).
That is why I am sending this message to you and hope you will print it and give it or send it via e-mail to everybody you know.
One thing I have learned is that each of us must take TOTAL responsibility for our own health care.
I thought I had done that because I always had an annual physical, had my annual mammogram and PAP smear, did monthly Self Breast Exam, went to the dentist at least twice/year, etc.
I even insisted on a sigmoidoscopy and a bone density test last year.
I don't have ovaries (and they were HEALTHY when they were removed!), but I have what is essentially ovarian cancer.

I had these classic symptoms and went to the Doctor.
He ran tests that were designed to determine whether there was a bacteria infection; these tests were negative, and I was diagnosed with ""Irritable Bowel Syndrome.""
I was again assured that I had Irritable Bowel Syndrome and was encouraged to go on my scheduled month long trip to Europe.
I INSISTED on more tests, and they (reluctantly) scheduled me for a CT-Scan (just to shut me up, I think).
The CT-Scan showed a lot of fluid in my abdomen (NOT normal!).
Tests revealed cancer cells in the fluid.

13,﻿snes-01190,"Did a CDC Doctor Say the Flu Shot Is Causing a Deadly Outbreak? 
Original","CDC Doctor: 'Disastrous' Flu Shot Is Causing Deadly Flu Outbreak
A CDC doctor has warned this year's ""disastrous"" flu shot may be responsible for the deadly flu epidemic sweeping the country.
""Some of the patients I've administered the flu shot to this year have died,"" the doctor said, adding ""I don't care who you are, this scares the crap out of me.""
""We have seen people dying across the country of the flu, and one thing nearly all of them have in common is they got the flu shot.""
The CDC doctor's experience of patients dying of the flu after receiving the flu shot is sadly not uncommon.
Yet health officials are still telling people to get the flu shot, even though it does not work well this season.
Many medical experts now agree it is more important to protect yourself and your family from the flu vaccine than the flu itself.
Every year the pharmaceutical industry, medical experts and the mainstream media work hard to convince us to get vaccinated against the flu.
Pharmaceutical companies provide mainstream media outlets with a huge percentage of their advertising revenue.
Big Pharma's dollars have effectively purchased the silence of mainstream media.
It is clear Big Pharma is desperate to ensure mainstream media outlets never tell us about adverse reactions or the toxic chemicals being injected into us in the flu shot.
Flu vaccines contain dangerous ingredients
The pharmaceutical industry, medical experts and the mainstream media admit to us that flu vaccines contain strains of the flu virus.
It is now a known fact that flu vaccines contain mercury, a heavy metal known to be hazardous for human health.
The flu vaccines actually do not immunize but sensitize the body against the virus
So rather than immunize, the flu shot actually only sensitizes the body against the virus.
And the fact that it causes individuals to get ill following a shot indicates immuno-suppression (i.e. lowering of the immunity).
For someone with an already suppressed immune system, injecting strains of the flu virus can have devastating consequences.
If your body is already working to fight off a virus or simply operating with low immunity, a vaccine injection could put your body in serious danger of contracting influenza with stronger symptoms, or even worse pneumonia and other contagious diseases.
There have been literally thousands of medical journal articles published that show injecting vaccines can lead to harmful immunological responses and a host of other infections.
Moreover, weak immunological responses only decrease a person's ability to fight the diseases that the vaccine was supposed to protect against in the first place.
Evidence now suggests that ingredients in flu vaccinations can actually cause serious neurological disorders.
Flu vaccines can contain many harmful materials including detergent, mercury, formaldehyde, and strains of live flu virus.
If you are still prevaricating, and wondering who to trust, consider this: The very people pushing flu vaccinations, and putting the fear of God into anybody who abstains, are making billions of dollars each year.
The investigation concluded that many individuals serving on two key advisory committees had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines.

Cameron Hardwick, a father in Indiana, was getting ready to give his three-year-old daughter a treat after she finished her dinner.
Luckily, though, before the Capri Sun got into the child's hands, Hardwick noticed something strange floating in the pouch.
It was mold.
Hardwick posted on Facebook to get the message out to other parents, urging friends and family to please read and share his message.
""I grabbed one [Capri Sun] out of the refrigerator and notice something odd about it...
it seems low in content, I take a closer look at the packaging and didn't notice a hole or anything,"" the post says.
Hardwick proceeded to shake up the Capri Sun, ""only to find an unknown substance floating around in the package."" EW.
""To say we are irate would be an understatement...
we don't give these to our children often but will NEVER again!

""It's unpleasant, but it's unlikely to make you or child sick,"" Capri Sun explains on the site.
""Although it's rare, it is possible for food mold to grow inside containers of preservative-free juice drinks if the pouch is compromised or punctured in any way on its journey from our facilities to your grocery stores.""
""The mold is naturally-occurring, and we understand your concerns,"" Capri Sun continues.
""That's why we created our clear bottom pouches so you can check for mold before enjoying your Capri Sun."" Geez...I wonder if I've ever unknowingly gulped down a mold-ridden Capri Sun, because I definitely have never checked the bottom for mold.
Capri Sun mentions in the FAQs that they recommend parents ""gently squeeze each pouch to check for leaks before serving Capri Sun to their kids."" Also, any leaky or punctured pouches should be thrown away.

DENVER (CBS4) Dog owners across the country are making the connection between chicken jerky treats that are made in China and serious illnesses in their dogs.
The Food and Drug Administration, FDA, has gotten hundreds of complaints about the popular treats and has issued warnings, but so far there has been no recall.
Candace Thaxton of Westlake, Ohio blames chicken jerky treats made in China for the death of her dog, Chansey, a 10-year-old pug.
When she got a new mixed breed puppy, Penny, and the puppy started having kidney problems, Thaxton made the connection.
Chicken jerky treats made in China were the only thing the two dogs had in common.
""I was sitting at the computer and I saw the warning on the chicken jerky treats,"" Thaxton said.
The  FDA, has issued 3 warnings regarding chicken jerky treats made in China.
In November 2011, the FDA warning stated that the agency saw an increase in the number of complaints it's received of dog illnesses, and the signs of illness included kidney problems.
Since then, Thaxton has been on a crusade to publicize the problem and hold the FDA and the treat makers accountable.
""Oh my gosh, that's exactly when and where my dog started getting sick,"" Safranek said.
Dog owners who are making the connection between chicken jerky treats made in China and illness in their dogs report these symptoms:

Tags: aborted babies, flavor chemicals, food corporations
NaturalNews) Every time you purchase mass-produced processed ""food"" from the likes of Kraft, PepsiCo, or Nestle, you're choosing, whether you realize it or not, to feed your family not only genetically engineered poisons and chemical additives, but also various flavoring agents manufactured using the tissue of aborted human babies.
It's true: A company based out of California, known as Senomyx, is in the business of using aborted embryonic cells to test fake flavoring chemicals, both savory and sweet, which are then added to things like soft drinks, candy and cookies.
Known as ""HEK-293,"" the aborted human fetal cell line used by Senomyx is manipulated to evaluate how the human palate will react to synthetic flavors used in the production of processed foods.
But because these ingredients can be legally disguised with vague descriptors like ""artificial flavors"" and even ""natural flavors,"" most consumers have no idea that these additives, in some cases, are actually made using the cell tissue of unborn babies that were murdered through abortion.
""What they don't tell the public is that they are using HEK 293 -- human embryonic kidney cells taken from an electively aborted baby to produce those receptors,"" Debi Vinnedge of the pro-life group Children of God for Life said about the ugly truth of the flavoring chemical industry.
Vaccines, ""beauty products"" loaded with chemicals made from unborn babies murdered via legalized genocide
Processed food isn't the only hidden source of additives made using aborted human fetal tissue -- many so-called ""beauty products"" and vaccines are also loaded with aborted baby tissue-derived additives.
According to EndAllDisease.com, Neocutis ""beauty"" products and anti-wrinkle creams are made from aborted male baby cells collected after a 14-week gestation period.
Many vaccines, including Merck & Co.'s MMR II vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, as well as ProQuad (Merck), Varivax (Merck), Pentacel (Sanofi Pasteur) and Havrix (GlaxoSmithKline), also contain derivatives of aborted human babies.

Ten deaths of children who used homeopathic teething tablets and 400 adverse events associated with the tablets have been reported to the <a> US Food and Drug Administration,<a> the agency said Wednesday.
The FDA warned caregivers to stop using the products, which parents use to soothe teething babies, and to take their child to a doctor immediately if the child experiences problems.
The agency is investigating the adverse events and the cases involving the deaths, as ""the relationship of these deaths to the homeopathic teething products has not yet been determined and is currently under review,"" according to a statement.

(Note from Erin: Just a heads up- this is not a CDC doctor quoted below.
Far too many people have looked up the fake news Snopes article, which was written well before this nurse was even quoted.
<b>That has nothing to do with this story.
<b> This is someone from the health department.
The comments below reflect that people are NOT reading the story.
We talked at length with the editor who interviewed the health department official that gave the quote.
They confirmed she did make the surprising statement.
You can see it's reflected in their headline as well, which raised eyebrows.
They too received much feedback about this controversial headline, which many PhDs in science and MDs have said they fully support - minus the part about receiving the vaccination regardless of the inefficacy.
Thank you in advance.

According to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), this year's flu is rampant in 49 states, with Wisconsin and Minnesota being hit especially hard.
And one nurse thinks she knows why.
While part of the blame lies with <b> the dominant flu strain this year, H3N2, which tends to be more severe and causes more severe symptoms than most other strains <b> 1 it also potentially lies with us:
""I believe that the low effective rate of the vaccine this year is due to the mutations that the virus made in the processing of the vaccine itself,"" said Anna Treague, nurse for Public Health.
""That is at LEAST part of the reason that influenza cases are so widespread this year."" 2
(That being said, Treague still thinks everyone should get a flu shot...
You've got to be kidding us.
The cognitive dissonance is shocking.)
The Health Department official says it's at LEAST part of the problem, if not the whole problem, and other experts agree.
Dr Mercola (his video is below), who has had the #1 health site- worldwide- for 20 years, agrees, ""It's no surprise at all"", he says.
We have countless other MDs and PhDs who concur as well.
As doctors continue to give the dangerous shot and the virus mutates, more people will get sick and the epidemic will worsen.
It's like a bad sci-fi movie.
Why does she want you to get it?
Because ""Even if the flu vaccine isn't as effective as it has been in year's past, it does help.
Some protection is better than no protection.""3 (Oh and even if it potentially causing the epidemic too?)
WATCH THIS VIRAL VIDEO, TOO.
According to Treague, at both the beginning and end of a person's life, the immune system isn't strong, so the body has to work harder to fight off viruses.
And that's why even though the shot is only 10% effective this year, at best, it's still worth your time getting.

Abortion after 20 weeks is now illegal in Wisconsin - with no exceptions for rape or incest.
On Monday, Gov. Scott Walker signed a bill that bans all non-emergency abortion after 20 weeks.
The legislation makes performing an abortion a felony punishable by up to three and a half years in prison and $10,000 in fines.
The only way abortions after 20 weeks are allowed is if the mother is likely to die or be severely injured.
Anti-abortion activists have coalesced around 20 weeks because, they say, that's when fetuses begin to feel pain.
The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, however, says that pain doesn't occur until 27 weeks.
Walker is running for the Republican nomination for president and is leading in some polls.
Late on Monday, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton attacked Walker on Twitter for the new law, writing, ""Gov. Walker signed dangerous abortion restrictions into law in WI - without exceptions for rape or incest.
Extreme and unacceptable.
Wisconsin legislators approved the abortion measure earlier this month, just days before Walker officially announced his bid for the White House.
GOP lawmakers said that the ban had nothing to do with the governor's ambitions, but the bill benefited from a few legislative shortcuts, including an expedited hearing process and an ""extraordinary"" July session, to land on his desk at a convenient political time for Walker.
The legislation comes less than a year after Walker, who was stuck in a tight reelection campaign, released an ad that called a woman's decision to terminate a pregnancy ""agonizing,"" saying he supported legislation that would make the decision between a woman and her doctor.
""I said I'm pro-life but I can only imagine how difficult a decision must be for someone who's thinking about ending their pregnancy.
That's why I support a law that provides more information to someone to make that decision,"" Walker said in the ad.
""The law still leaves the decision to the woman and her doctor.

A New Jersey-based food company is recalling Aunt Jemima frozen pancakes, waffles and French toast because they could be contaminated with Listeria.
Listeriosis is a serious infection usually caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes.
The infection is most likely to sicken pregnant women and their newborns, adults aged 65 or older, and people with weakened immune systems.
Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.

26,﻿snes-01752,"New research has uncovered that the true cause of fibromyalgia is an excess number of specific nerves found near a specific kind of blood vessel in the hands and feet, ending the controversy over the diseases cause and mechanism","Fibromyalgia Mystery Finally Solved!
Researchers Find Main Source of Pain in Blood Vessels.
Researchers Find Main Source of Pain in Blood Vessels.
Researchers have found the main source of pain in Fibromyalgia patients, and contrary to what many believe, it does not stem from the brain.
The findings mark the end of a decades-old mystery about the disease, which many doctors believed was conjured in patients' imaginations.
The mystery of Fibromyalgia has left millions of sufferers searching for hope in pain medications.
Up until recently, many physicians thought that the disease was ""imaginary"" or psychological, but scientists have now revealed that the main source of pain stems from a most unlikely place- excess blood vessels in the hand, legs and foot.
The discovery may lead to new treatments and perhaps even a total cure in the future, bringing relief to as many as 5 million Americans thought to have the disease.
To solve the Fibromyalgia mystery, researchers zeroed in on the skin from the hand of one patient who had a lack of the sensory nerve fibers, causing a reduced reaction to pain.
They then took skin samples from the hands of Fibromyalgia patients and were surprised to find an extremely excessive amount of a particular type of nerve fiber called arteriole-venule (AV) shunts.
Up until this point scientists had thought that these fibers were only responsible for regulating blood flow, and did not play any role in pain sensation, but now they've discovered that there is a direct link between these nerves and the widespread body pain that Fibromyalgia sufferers feel.
The breakthrough also could solve the lingering question of why many sufferers have extremely painful hands and foot as well as other ""tender points"" throughout the body, and why cold weather seems to aggravate the symptoms.
In addition to feeling widespread deep tissue pain, many Fibromyalgia patients also suffer from debilitating fatigue.
Rice explained: ""We previously thought that these nerve endings were only involved in regulating blood flow at a subconscious level, yet here we had evidences that the blood vessel endings could also contribute to our conscious sense of touch...
and also pain,"" Rice said.
""This mismanaged blood flow could be the source of muscular pain and achiness, and the sense of fatigue which are thought to be due to a build-up of lactic acid and low levels of inflammation fibromyalgia patients.
This, in turn, could contribute to the hyperactivity in the brain.""
Current treatments for the disease have not brought complete relief to the millions of sufferers.
Therapies include narcotic pain medicines; anti-seizure drugs, anti-depressants and even simple advice such as ""get more sleep and exercise regularly."" Now that the cause of Fibromyalgia has been pinpointed, patients are looking forward to an eventual cure.
Other expressed frustration about how much they had suffered already:
People have suffered through this since they were invented.
The announcement has the potential to unlock better future treatments and undoubtedly has patients all over the world rejoicing that the mystery of Fibromyalgia has finally been solved.

27,﻿snes-03533,"Is Monsanto Suppressing Evidence of a Cancerous Herbicide in Food? 
Original","Not a single mainstream media outlet has covered this appalling new report that shows millions of people being poisoned by a chemical that does not belong in our food.
This chemical is ending up in processed foods like Cheerios, Ritz Crackers, and Oreos and being consumed by humans across the world.
<b>Share this shocking new report with everyone you know....<b>
<b>A FDA-registered food safety laboratory tested iconic American food for residues of the weed killer glyphosate (aka Monsanto's Roundup) and found ALARMING amounts.
[image of glyphosate food testing results] 
* Independent research links glyphosate to cancer (sources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and it has been deemed a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organization's team of international cancer experts.
Even non-GMO and organic food!
* Glyphosate is not just used on GMOs. Conventional (non-organic farmers) use Roundup as a drying agent on crops, such as oats and wheat.
* As the active ingredient in popular ""Roundup"" herbicide, millions of people are using this stuff around their homes, and it's widely used at parks and other public spaces.
So, that is why it's not just GMO-filled junk food that is laced with glyphosate.
It's contaminating organic and non-GMO foods, and it's even in our honey!
There are still thousands of other brands and whole foods that have not been tested for glyphosate residues, so we can't be so sure that our own organic, non-GMO, and unprocessed food is safe.
Americans are effectively being forced to eat this poison until something is done to stop the rampant use of this chemical.
Monsanto doesn't want the public to know these findings for obvious reasons.
Our public agencies are allowing corporations to poison Americans for profit.
In 2013, the EPA massively increased the industry standard of what is considered a ""safe"" level of glyphosate on our food, in order to make enormous amounts seem A-OK.
Instead of properly regulating, they effectively raised the ""safe"" level so that no one can blame the industry for poisoning us with unlawful amounts of chemicals.
The EPA has a long and sordid history of doing whatever Monsanto wants and you have to ask yourself why this continues to happen and how we can make it stop.
The EPA continues to pander to Monsanto, as they keep postponing and dragging their feet to evaluate glyphosate's link to cancer in humans.
It's time for the EPA to put the public health above the corrupt desires of corporations.
When it comes to the FDA, they are not protecting the American public from glyphosate either.
Could it be that Monsanto didn't like the results they started getting - especially since the FDA found glyphosate in foods that should be especially safe like BABY FOOD?
Monsanto will do whatever it takes to keep that story out of the public eye.
If you really want to stop the corruption perpetuated by Monsanto and the large chemical companies - this is how we shut them down!
It's been shown that people who eat organic foods have less glyphosate and other synthetic pesticides in their system.","title of article as clickbait </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> call to action </s> establishing legitimacy </s> emotional appeals </s> fear </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> emotional appeals </s> anger </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> rhetorical tricks </s> anxiety </s> emotional appeals </s> call to action </s> establishing legitimacy </s> bolded, underline or italicized </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> emotional appeals </s> fear </s> bolded, underline or italicized </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> call to action </s> establishing legitimacy </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> bolded, underline or italicized </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to not be credible in this context </s> uppercase words </s> less robust evidence or outdated evidence_verified </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> legitimate persuasive techniques (e.g., multiple sources, broad range of appeals, metaphor, humor, rhetorical question) </s> establishing legitimacy </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> wrong cause-effect </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> emotional appeals </s> fear </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> rhetorical tricks </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> rhetorical tricks </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> rhetorical tricks </s> emotional appeals </s> anger </s> rhetorical tricks </s> rhetorical tricks </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> emotional appeals </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> rhetorical tricks </s> fear </s> financial motivation </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> rhetorical tricks </s> financial motivation </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> uppercase words </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> anger </s> emotional appeals </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> inappropriate analogy or false connection </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> establishing legitimacy </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> uppercase words </s> uppercase words </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> emotional appeals </s> anger </s> hope </s> uppercase words </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> call to action </s> establishing legitimacy </s> bolded, underline or italicized </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> call to action </s> establishing legitimacy </s> lack of citation for evidence </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence",false,"Is Monsanto Suppressing Evidence of a Cancerous Herbicide in Food? 
Original </s></s> Not a single mainstream media outlet has covered this appalling new report that shows millions of people being poisoned by a chemical that does not belong in our food.
This chemical is ending up in processed foods like Cheerios, Ritz Crackers, and Oreos and being consumed by humans across the world.
<b>A FDA-registered food safety laboratory tested iconic American food for residues of the weed killer glyphosate (aka Monsanto's Roundup) and found ALARMING amounts.
[image of glyphosate food testing results] 
* Independent research links glyphosate to cancer (sources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and it has been deemed a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organization's team of international cancer experts.
* Glyphosate is not just used on GMOs. Conventional (non-organic farmers) use Roundup as a drying agent on crops, such as oats and wheat.
So, that is why it's not just GMO-filled junk food that is laced with glyphosate.
It's contaminating organic and non-GMO foods, and it's even in our honey!
There are still thousands of other brands and whole foods that have not been tested for glyphosate residues, so we can't be so sure that our own organic, non-GMO, and unprocessed food is safe.
Americans are effectively being forced to eat this poison until something is done to stop the rampant use of this chemical.
In 2013, the EPA massively increased the industry standard of what is considered a ""safe"" level of glyphosate on our food, in order to make enormous amounts seem A-OK.
The EPA continues to pander to Monsanto, as they keep postponing and dragging their feet to evaluate glyphosate's link to cancer in humans.
When it comes to the FDA, they are not protecting the American public from glyphosate either.
Monsanto will do whatever it takes to keep that story out of the public eye.

PLEASE PASS THIS OUTRAGE TO EVERYONE ON YOUR LIST!!!
THIS should be read by everyone, especially important to those over 75 .......
Your hospital Medicare admittance has just changed under Obama Care.
If you are admitted by an emergency room doctor it is treated as outpatient care where hospital costs are not covered.
This is only the tip of the iceberg for Obama Care.
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS...
At age 76 when you most need it most, you are not eligible for cancer treatment * see page 272.

** Page 65/section 164: The plan will be subsidized (by the government) for all union members, union retirees and for community organizations (such as the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now - ACORN)
** Page 203/line 14-15: The tax imposed under this section will not be treated as a tax.
** Page 241 and 253: Doctors will all be paid the same regardless of specialty, and the government will set all doctors' fees.

29,﻿tron-01803,Doctors Expose Zika Virus Hoax,"10 Reasons Why Zika Virus Fear Is Another Fraudulent Medical Hoax And Jab Industry Funding Scam
The developmental deformities are actually caused by <b> exposure to toxic insecticide and larvicide chemicals <b>, not Zika virus.
But because Zika virus fear fits a convenient funding narrative for chemical giants and jjab manufacturers, it is being played up by the corrupt, criminally-run CDC and the Obama administration to <b> funnel billions of dollars into the hands of jjab corporations <b> while ignoring the real causes of microcephaly.
A group of doctors from South America are now saying the brain deformations the world is witnessing are caused by the mass fumigation of low-income Brazilian people with a chemical larvicide, not by mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus.
By the way, the CDC is totally fabricating its claim that all cases of microcephaly are caused by Zika virus.
#4) Zika virus fear was just used by Congress to remove bans on other toxic pesticide chemicals that cause cancer and Alzheimer's disease
#5) Zika virus hype was also invoked by Obama to funnel another $1.8 billion to the jjab industry, claiming anyone who opposed the funding ""opposed pregnant women""
#6) Zika virus fear has been used as a weapon of control to terrorize the people of the Americas by violating their private property
The latest act of political terrorism on the illusory world stage is yet another alleged disease epidemic - this time the ""Zika Virus,"" which officials are warning (just like they did with Ebola) might turn into a global pandemic.
And the martial law pandemonium has already begun in Brazil, where government officials have now declared that they can ""legally"" break and enter into people's homes and private property, if it's suspected that Zika-harboring mosquitoes might be living there.
Spreading fear about viruses is so effective that the governments and health ""authorities"" of the world roll out the same scam every few years...
#8) Zika virus fear is being used to justify the release of genetically modified mosquitoes into the wild
Not only does Zika fear allow governments to funnel money to jjab companies and legalize more chemical insecticides; it also justifies their release of genetically modified mosquitoes into the wild (with unknown future consequences).
What you're NOT being told is that the epicenter of the Zika virus spread is precisely where GM mosquitoes were released last year.
Now that Zika fear is being hyped up by the corrupt, scientifically illiterate mainstream media, most people just stand aside as governments throughout the Americas <b> spray all sorts of toxic, deadly chemicals all over the place.
The most shocking realization in all this is that the mass spraying of chemicals, the release of GM mosquitoes, and the use of Zika jjabs will all <b> spread Zika even faster.
Zika is spread by the very things that we're all told are trying to stop Zika, and as the problem gets worse, all the chemical spraying and jjabs get ramped up to insane levels, causing even more insane levels of Zika virus.","distinctive linguistic features </s> title of article as clickbait </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> shifting hypothesis </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> bolded, underline or italicized </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> financial motivation </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> shifting hypothesis </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> wrong cause-effect </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> shifting hypothesis </s> establishing legitimacy </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> evidence does not support conclusion </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> claims without evidence </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> inappropriate analogy or false connection </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> financial motivation </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> evidence does not support conclusion </s> claims without evidence </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> shifting hypothesis </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> shifting hypothesis </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> bolded, underline or italicized </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> financial motivation </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> financial motivation </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> establishing legitimacy </s> shifting hypothesis </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> financial motivation </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> shifting hypothesis </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> uppercase words </s> uppercase words </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> shifting hypothesis </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> uppercase words </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> bolded, underline or italicized </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> shifting hypothesis </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> uppercase words </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> bolded, underline or italicized </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> bolded, underline or italicized </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> bolded, underline or italicized </s> distinctive linguistic features",false,"Doctors Expose Zika Virus Hoax </s></s> 10 Reasons Why Zika Virus Fear Is Another Fraudulent Medical Hoax And Jab Industry Funding Scam

Improve Your Hearing Naturally
What if I told you there are very effective all natural methods you can use at home to restore your lost hearing, safely, with no side effects?
How would you like to hear out of both ears equally, clearly and be able to understand every word other people are saying?
<b> Is hearing loss affecting your social life, your family, your career and maybe even your safety?
Maybe conversations get drowned out by background noise and all you can do is pretend you are listening or constantly ask the person to repeat what they said.
My name is Mike Tucker, I recently turned 50 and I was struck with sudden hearing loss, I lost most of my hearing in one ear and 10% in the other.
I had trouble hearing the TV, could not understand phone conversations and was constantly saying what....
I could hear people talking but not understand the words.
I was always asking people to repeat things, sometimes two and three times.
Also for me, with only one ear, I was not able to tell where sound was coming from.
<b>  Family and relatives didn't want to talk to me on the phone because they knew I could not hear them well.
<b>Social situations became next to impossible <b> to function at so I avoided places where I knew I would not be able to hear anyways (talks, lectures, parties, bars).
Plus I knew other people that wore hearing aids.
I was feeling really bad so I decided to flush out my system with herbs and other natural cleansing methods to get rid of the steroids and the wonderful side effects that they didn't tell me about.
I started my own research on natural cures, herbs and supplements and how they related to hearing loss.
My Hearing Began To Come Back!
I started noticing sounds I could not hear before!
The fact is most hearing loss sufferers can be helped.
I think most people will be able to tell if they can be helped or not.

Damage to your inner ear from disease, blockage, noise or lack of nutrients will cause hearing loss.
Poor blood flow, fluid from an infection and other factors can cause the tiny hair follicles in your inner ear to die.
The sad truth is most doctors will never know why your hearing went bad.
<b> Day by day the cells in your inner ear are dying, don't wait until your hearing is gone <u>forever.<u><b>
There are <u>natural herbs and supplements<u> you can take that can greatly improve and even restore your hearing.

32,﻿tron-02208,Chaplain Says Officials Ordered Him To Cover Christian Symbols In VA Chapel,"VA hospital orders Christian symbols to be covered inside its chapel
Brownie Marie  03 June 2014 | 7:15 PM
A Veterans Affairs hospital in Michigan was told last month to cover up all Christian symbols inside of its chapel.
The Oscar G. Johnson VA Medical Center was found in non-compliance with a 2008 federal regulation that mandates that the house of worship be nonsectarian.
""The chapel must be maintained as religiously neutral, reflecting no particular faith tradition,"" the policy <a> states <a>.
Statues of Jesus and Mary, an altar, and a crucifix were encircled with a curtain at the Iron Mountain chapel after an inspection by the National Chaplain Center discovered the unauthorized items. The chapel's stained glass windows have not yet been replaced, and are also covered by a curtain.
Our Saviour's Lutheran Church pastor Richard Riley said the move is just one example of an anti-Christian movement taking place in the country.
""Christianity, not only globally, but particularly in the United States, is really under attack,"" he told <a> Fox News <a>.
""Christianity is coming under some horrendous conflict from the media and to some degree from our own government.""
Riley also said that having a Christian chapel is constitutionally protected.
""Christians have constitutional rights. We have a right to voice our opinion. Just because you are a Christian doesn't mean you lose your First Amendment rights,"" he insisted.
Rapid City Journal Black Hills Health Care System Director Stephen R. DiStasio said that the concealment of religious symbols does not detract from the purpose of the chapel.
""Their key purpose is to provide a designated space for a religious service at the request of the veteran and their family, a space for personal reflection and a space for community services,"" he said in a <a> statement <a>.
""This plan necessitates some changes in the appearance of the chapels, but it continues to support our ability to meet the spiritual needs of veterans and others.""

Brownie Marie  03 June 2014 | 7:15 PM
A Veterans Affairs hospital in Michigan was told last month to cover up all Christian symbols inside of its chapel.
The Oscar G.
Johnson VA Medical Center was found in non-compliance with a 2008 federal regulation that mandates that the house of worship be nonsectarian.
""The chapel must be maintained as religiously neutral, reflecting no particular faith tradition,"" the policy <a> states <a>.
Statues of Jesus and Mary, an altar, and a crucifix were encircled with a curtain at the Iron Mountain chapel after an inspection by the National Chaplain Center discovered the unauthorized items.
The chapel's stained glass windows have not yet been replaced, and are also covered by a curtain.
Our Saviour's Lutheran Church pastor Richard Riley said the move is just one example of an anti-Christian movement taking place in the country.
""Christianity, not only globally, but particularly in the United States, is really under attack,"" he told <a> Fox News <a>.
""Christianity is coming under some horrendous conflict from the media and to some degree from our own government.""
Riley also said that having a Christian chapel is constitutionally protected.
""Christians have constitutional rights.
We have a right to voice our opinion.
Just because you are a Christian doesn't mean you lose your First Amendment rights,"" he insisted.
Rapid City Journal Black Hills Health Care System Director Stephen R.
DiStasio said that the concealment of religious symbols does not detract from the purpose of the chapel.
""Their key purpose is to provide a designated space for a religious service at the request of the veteran and their family, a space for personal reflection and a space for community services,"" he said in a <a> statement <a>.
""This plan necessitates some changes in the appearance of the chapels, but it continues to support our ability to meet the spiritual needs of veterans and others.""

There she had to have her stomach pumped. The doctors asked her where she had eaten, what she had eaten. After telling the doctor, the doctor asked if by chance they brought some home. The husband said yes and went home to get it so they could take tests on it in their lab.

36,﻿snes-00512,The National Cancer Institute has admitted that cannabis kills cancer,"It is little surprise that for a couple of decades at the direction of the multi-national pharmaceutical industry, and more recently the for-profit prison and law enforcement industry, the federal government and National Institutes of Health (NIH) have concealed a highly effective and completely natural remedy and relief for cancer.
In just the past two weeks, the federal government and NIH have quietly confirmed that cannabis (marijuana) is very effective at killing cancer cells without harming healthy cells like radiation and chemotherapy.
In fact, on the NIH website devoted to the hideous disease, Cancer.gov, they published the truth about marijuana and its effectiveness at combatting cancer in a stunning reversal of over four decades of deliberate fear-mongering and propaganda portraying the common weed as dangerous; all to satisfy the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, prison system, and law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal level.
After preaching since the 1970s that marijuana had absolutely no medicinal effect or value for human beings, and putting the weed in the same classification as heroin, the Department of Health's National Cancer Institute is now ""advising that cannabinoids are useful in treating cancer and its side effects by smoking, eating it in a baked product, drinking herbal teas, or even spraying it under the tongue.""  The U.S. Department of Health also made a partial list of other highly-beneficial medicinal uses of marijuana such as reducing anti-inflammatory activity, blocking cancerous cell growth,  relieving muscle spasms in multiple sclerosis sufferers, as an effective anti-viral agent, an anti-bacterial and preventing the growth of blood vessels that supply tumors.
The abomination is that the organization knew all along that a profuse amount of well-documented scientific studies proved that a 3,000 year-old ""medicinal weed"" any American could grow in their garden was effectively killing cancer cells, shrinking malignant tumors, and relieving the effects of the disease.
The last thing the law enforcement and highly-profitable prison industry wanted was for marijuana's medicinal value to become public knowledge and face public pressure to decriminalize the weed.
As much as the pharmaceutical industrial complex wants to continue getting extremely rich off of slowly killing cancer patients with ineffective and expensive treatments, the law enforcement industry thrives on the continued criminalization of a common weed.
Still, because there is huge money in perpetuating the disease with ineffective drugs, fraudulent treatment centers, and manufacturing radiological machines it took until this past April for the United States government's National Institute on Drug Abuse to revise their publications and admit the many, many benefits of cannabis for medicinal use.
It is likely that every American in this country has known, or lost, a loved one to the horrid disease and it is absolutely despicable, and frankly evil, that the medical industry helped keep an incredibly inexpensive and highly-effective cancer-killing drug out of reach.
It is unclear who in government is responsible for helping conceal the now-proven medicinal benefits of weed, or who in government revealed that for at least a decade the National Institutes of Health and Department of Health have known that instead of being a <i>""dangerous drug""<i> like heroin, marijuana kills cancer cells and dog forbid may put a smile on a cancer patient's face.","distrusting government or corporations </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> financial motivation </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> financial motivation </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> bolded, underline or italicized </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> financial motivation </s> emotional appeals </s> anger </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> financial motivation </s> anger </s> emotional appeals </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> bolded, underline or italicized </s> financial motivation",false,"The National Cancer Institute has admitted that cannabis kills cancer </s></s> It is little surprise that for a couple of decades at the direction of the multi-national pharmaceutical industry, and more recently the for-profit prison and law enforcement industry, the federal government and National Institutes of Health (NIH) have concealed a highly effective and completely natural remedy and relief for cancer.

In fact, on the NIH website devoted to the hideous disease, Cancer.gov, they published the truth about marijuana and its effectiveness at combatting cancer in a stunning reversal of over four decades of deliberate fear-mongering and propaganda portraying the common weed as dangerous; all to satisfy the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, prison system, and law enforcement agencies at the local, state, and federal level.
After preaching since the 1970s that marijuana had absolutely no medicinal effect or value for human beings, and putting the weed in the same classification as heroin, the Department of Health's National Cancer Institute is now ""advising that cannabinoids are useful in treating cancer and its side effects by smoking, eating it in a baked product, drinking herbal teas, or even spraying it under the tongue.""

39,﻿snes-05674,Cut Onions Contamination,"Spoiled Onions
<i> Watch out for those spoiled onions...<i>
I had the wonderful privilege of touring Mullins Food Products.
Mullins is HUGE and is owned by 11 brothers and sisters in the Mullins family.
My friend Jeanne is the CEO.
The facility is mammoth.
We toured about 280,000 square feet!
Questions about food poisoning came up and I wanted to share what I learned from a chemist.
The guy who gave us our tour is named Ed. He's one of the brothers.
Ed is a chemistry expert and is involved in developing most of the sauce formula.
He's even developed sauce formula for McDonald's.
Keep in mind that Ed is a food chemistry whiz.
During the tour, someone asked if we really needed to worry about mayonnaise.
People are always worried that mayonnaise will spoil.
Ed's answer will surprise you.
Ed said that all commercially-made Mayo is completely safe.
""It doesn't even have to be refrigerated.
No harm in refrigerating it, but it's not really necessary."" He explained that the pH in mayonnaise is set at a point that bacteria could not survive in that environment.
He then talked about the quint essential picnic, with the bowl of potato salad sitting on the table and how everyone blames the mayonnaise when someone gets sick.
Ed says that when food poisoning is reported, the first thing the officials look for is when the 'victim' last ate ONIONS and where those onions came from (in the potato salad?).
Ed says it's not the mayonnaise (as long as it's not homemade Mayo) that spoils in the outdoors.
It's probably the onions, and if not the onions, it's the POTATOES.
He explained, onions are a huge magnet for bacteria, especially uncooked onions.
You should never plan to keep a portion of a sliced onion.
He says it's not even safe if you put it in a zip-lock bag and put it in your refrigerator.
It's already contaminated enough just by being cut open and out for a bit, that it can be a danger to you (and doubly watch out for those onions you put in your hotdogs at the baseball park!)
Ed says if you take the leftover onion and cook it like crazy you'll probably be okay, but if you slice that leftover onion and put on your sandwich, you're asking for trouble.
Both the onions and the moist potato in a potato salad, will attract and grow bacteria faster than any commercial mayonnaise will even begin to break down.
So, how's that for news?
I (the author) am going to be very careful about my onions from now on.
For some reason, I see a lot of credibility coming from a chemist and a company, that produces millions of pounds of mayonnaise every year.'
Also, dogs should NEVER eat onions.
Their stomachs cannot metabolize onions.","distinctive linguistic features </s> bolded, underline or italicized </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> uppercase words </s> using anecdotes and personal experience as evidence </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> uppercase words </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> uppercase words </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> uppercase words",false,"Cut Onions Contamination </s></s> Spoiled Onions

Ed is a chemistry expert and is involved in developing most of the sauce formula.
During the tour, someone asked if we really needed to worry about mayonnaise.
People are always worried that mayonnaise will spoil.
No harm in refrigerating it, but it's not really necessary."" He explained that the pH in mayonnaise is set at a point that bacteria could not survive in that environment.
Ed says that when food poisoning is reported, the first thing the officials look for is when the 'victim' last ate ONIONS and where those onions came from (in the potato salad?).
Ed says it's not the mayonnaise (as long as it's not homemade Mayo) that spoils in the outdoors.
He explained, onions are a huge magnet for bacteria, especially uncooked onions.
He says it's not even safe if you put it in a zip-lock bag and put it in your refrigerator.
Both the onions and the moist potato in a potato salad, will attract and grow bacteria faster than any commercial mayonnaise will even begin to break down. </s></s> using anecdotes and personal experience as evidence </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> political figures or political argument </s> using anecdotes and personal experience as evidence </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> political figures or political argument </s> religion or ideology </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> freedom of choice and agency </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> politicizing health issues </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> politicizing health issues </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> politicizing health issues </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> politicizing health issues </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> freedom of choice and agency </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> freedom of choice and agency </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> politicizing health issues </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> freedom of choice and agency"

By Gerard du Cann, The Sun
September 10, 2018 | 11:00am | Updated
Drinking young people’s blood could help you live longer and prevent age-related diseases, a study has found.
Blood factors taken from younger animals have been found to improve the later-life health of older creatures.
The study, published in Nature, was conducted by researchers from University College London (UCL), who said it could reduce the chances of developing age-related disorders.
Geneticist Dame Linda Partridge said these included cancer and heart disease.
She told The Times: “I would say aging is the emperor of all diseases.”
“A lot of people regard aging as ‘natural’ and that therefore you shouldn’t interfere with nature. But we’ve always considered it an ethical imperative to cure illness where we find it.”
The research is part of a wave of studies and trials backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel at a San Francisco start-up called Ambrosia.
Separate trials by Ambrosia involved 70 participants, all 35 or older.
After being given plasma — the main component of blood — from volunteers ages 16 to 25, researchers noted improvements in biomarkers for various diseases.
Ambrosia currently offers teenage blood plasma to customers at a cost of $8,000 for 2½ liters.
The UCL trials showed older mice did not develop age-related diseases after being given young blood.
The mice also maintained sharp cognitive function.

1991 Honorable Mention
Confirmed True by Darwin
One morning I was called to the emergency room by the head ER nurse.
She directed me to a patient who had refused to describe his problem other then to say that he ""needed a doctor who took care of men's troubles."" The patient, about 40, was pale, febrile, and obviously uncomfortable, and had little to say as he gingerly opened his trousers to expose a bit of angry red and black-and-blue scrotal skin.
After I asked the nurse to leave us, the patient permitted me to remove his trousers, shorts, and two or three yards of foul-smelling, stained gauze wrapped about his scrotum, which was swollen to twice the size of a grapefruit and extremely tender.
A jagged zig-zag laceration, oozing pus and blood, extended down the left scrotum.
Amid the matted hair, edematous skin, and various exudates, I saw some half-buried dark linear objects and asked the patient what they were.
Several days earlier, he replied, he had injured himself in the machine shop where he worked, and had closed the laceration himself with a heavy-duty stapling gun.
The dark objects were one-inch staples of the type used in putting up wallboard.
We x-rayed the patients scrotum to locate the staples; admitting him to the hospital; and gave him tetanus antitoxin, a broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy, and hexachlorophene sitz baths prior to surgery the next morning.
The procedure consisted of exploration and debridement of the left side of the scrotal pouch.
Eight rusty staples were retrieved, and the skin edges were trimmed and freshened.
The left testis had been avulsed and was missing.
The stump of the spermatic cord was recovered at the inguinal canal, debrided, and the vessels ligated properly, though not much of a hematoma was present.
Through-and through Penrose drains were sutured loosely in site, and the skin was loosely closed.
Convalescence was uneventful, and before his release from the hospital less then a week later, the patient confided the rest of his story to me.
An unmarried loner, he usually didn't leave the machine shop at lunchtime with his co-workers.
Finding himself alone, he had begun the regular practice of masturbating by holding his penis against the canvas drive-belt of a large floor-based piece of running machinery.
One day, as he approached orgasm, he lost his concentration and leaned too close to the belt.
When his scrotum suddenly became caught between the pulley-wheel and the drive-belt, he was thrown into the air and landed a few feet away.
Unaware that he had lost his left testis, and perhaps too stunned to feel much pain, he stapled the wound closed and resumed work.
I can only assume he abandoned this method of self-gratification.

Original","California mom bitten by 'kissing bug' warns others about danger of 'silent killer' parasitic disease 
When Lynn Kaufer Hodson was bitten by a triatomine, also known as a ""kissing bug,"" she couldn't even feel it.
It wasn't until a large, itchy lump appeared on her neck the next day that she realized some type of pest had sucked her blood.
Hodson had been staying with family in a camper on her ranch in Grass Valley, Calif., in November 2016 while she waited to move into her new home in Penn Valley - a town that was a roughly 30-minute drive away.
At first, Hodson just believed a spider or mosquito had bitten her while she was staying in a fifth wheel camper.
""It was super itchy for like two or three weeks,"" Hodson, 49, recalled to Fox News, though she admitted she initially decided against going to the doctor.
It wasn't until two months later that Hodson learned - by accident - the type of deadly bug that had actually bitten her.
Weeks later, the wife and mother received a shocking letter in the mail from the American Red Cross that revealed there were signs she had been infected with the rare parasite <i>Trypanosoma cruzi <i>, which triggers a dangerous illness called Chagas disease.
Hodson immediately underwent follow-up testing at the Center of Excellence for Chagas Disease at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center, where doctors confirmed she had contracted Chagas.
The 49-year-old had to wait two months, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prioritized high risk patients such as pregnant women and those with AIDS, before she could get any medications to treat the infection.
""They say if you get it treated right away research shows it's effective,"" Hodson said.
At least 8 million people have been infected with Chagas disease in Central and South America and Mexico, according to the CDC's most recent report in December 2017.
And an estimated 300,000 Americans in the U.S. also have the illness, a recent news release from the American Heart Association shows.
However, Hodson said the disease is called the ""silent killer"" because many people don't show any symptoms.
Lynn Kaufer Hodson, who turns 50 in November, said she sees a cardiologist once a year to monitor her heart activity.
(Lynn Kaufer Hodson)
(Lynn Kaufer Hodson)
Kissing bugs spread the infection by biting a human, typically on their face (hence the nickname), and then defecating near the wound.
Chagas disease can cause life-threatening heart issues, including heart disease, strokes, arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
About one-third of those infected will develop chronic heart disease, according to the AHA.
""There is no urgency, no concern, no anything with this disease right now.
""There is no urgency, no concern, no anything with this disease right now.
You can't see it,"" Hodson said, explaining that she's hoping to ""put a face"" to the disease so others will take it seriously.

43,﻿snes-03632,Life expectancy in the United States is now lower because of Obamacare.,"Americans' health deteriorating under Obamacare as life expectancies plunge
Tags: Americans, life expectancy, plummeting health
(NaturalNews) For many years, the assumption has been that the United States leads the world as an advanced civilization, dominating in categories like education, quality of life, and life expectancy.
But a new study released this year by the Society of Actuaries (SOA) paints a much different picture, suggesting that Americans are less healthy and will more than likely live much shorter lives compared to those in previous generations.
The 36-page report reveals that the average 65-year-old American man today will most likely die just short of his 86th birthday, while the average 65-year-old American woman only has about two years longer until she dies, on average, around age 88.
This might not sound like anything out of the ordinary, except that these figures are actually down compared to last year's report using the same criteria.
Over the past several years, the report explains, American health has taken a major downturn.
Life expectancy amongst 65-year-olds is down by about six months, on average.
It's also down for younger Americans, who are likewise expected to live about six months less than in previous generations.
In nearly every generational category, including ""Baby Boomers,"" ""Generation X,"" and ""Millennials,"" life expectancy is down, and will likely continue to go down.
This report also highlights increasing rates of suicide within younger populations, a sad state of affairs that says even more about the current state of our society.
And if things continue on the current trajectory, eventually overall life expectancy will be on the downturn - that is, unless the factors contributing to this decline are addressed and brought to bear.
If they aren't, the average American life will likely continue to decline into the future.
By looking at this new life expectancy data through the lens of post-retirement disbursements, employers can determine whether or not their liabilities will increase or decrease - and based on the most current data, it appears that a decrease is on the way.
""The updated scale provides the latest information to help accurately measure pension obligations,"" says Dale Hall, managing director of research at the SOA.
""However, it is up to pension plan sponsors, working with their plan actuaries, to determine how to incorporate emerging mortality improvement data into their plan valuations.""
With the growing popularity of 401k accounts as opposed to pensions, the new data can also help employees who handle their own retirement affairs better ascertain how much they need to make, and how much they need to save, to live comfortably until their deaths.
All of this information makes a difference when determining the price of annuities and insurance contracts whereby insurance companies are obligated to pay out until the time a person dies.
At the same time, some experts claim that longevity rates in the long-term are still on an upward trajectory, and that soon-to-be retirees and younger folks alike need to take into account the fact that they could live much longer than the latest figures suggest, and to plan accordingly.",establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence - out of context_verified </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> financial motivation </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility,false,"Life expectancy in the United States is now lower because of Obamacare. </s></s> Americans' health deteriorating under Obamacare as life expectancies plunge

44,﻿snes-05837,Muslims in the U.S. are specifically exempted from legislative requirements to purchase health insurance.,"THIS MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL!!!
I AM SO MAD!
What does this word mean?
The word ""Dhimmitude"" is found in the new health care bill.
So what does it mean?
Obama used it in the health care bill.
Now isn't this interesting?
It is also included in the health care law.
I had never heard the word until now, so I typed it into Google and started reading.
Pretty interesting!
It's on Page 107 of the Obama healthcare bill.
I looked this up on Google and, yep, it exists.....it is a REAL word.
Dhimmitude is the Muslim system of controlling non-Muslin populations conquered through jihad (Holy War).
Specifically, it is the TAXING of non-Muslims in exchange for tolerating their presenceAND as a coercive means of converting conquered remnants to Islam!
ObamaCare allows the establishment of Dhimmitude and Sharia Muslim diktat in the United States!
Muslims are specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance and also from the penalty tax for being uninsured!
Islam considers insurance to be ""gambling,"" ""risk-taking,"" and ""usury"" and is thus banned.
Muslims are specifically granted exemption based on this.
How convenient.
So I, as a Christian, will have crippling IRS liens placed against all of my assets and will face hard prison time because I refuse to buy insurance or pay the penalty tax.
Meanwhile, Louis Farrakhan will have no such penalty and will have 100% of his health insurance needs paid for by the de-facto government insurance.
Non-Muslims will be paying a tax to subsidize Muslims.
This is Dhimmitude.
This is Dhimmitude.
This is Dhimmitude.
American citizens need to know about it......
Every non-Muslim in the United States of America needs to know about it.
ObamaCare discriminates against Christians and Jews by denying them special exemptions extended to other religions.
If you are a mainstream Christian or a Jew, you need not apply to Opt Out of ObamaCare; that exemption is reserved for Muslims, Scientologists, Amish, Christian Scientists and Native American Indians who have a ""conscientious objection"" to insurance.
A conscientious objection to theft committed by rouge politicians under the color of law with the threat of violence for non-compliance isn't sufficient in America today to exempt average Americans from the stranglehold of government.
Believe it or not, if you are a Muslim you may claim a special religious exemption to Obama-Care that is denied to main-stream Christians and Jews.
Or if you prefer a New-Age religion to Islam, you may become a Scientologist and Opt Out of ObamaCare's mandatory purchase of health insurance.
Or, if you happen to be of Native American Indian extraction you too can opt out of the insurance laws by which everyone else in America must abide.","uppercase words </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> emotional appeals </s> anger </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> uppercase words </s> politicizing health issues </s> ingroup vs. outgroup </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> uppercase words </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> uppercase words </s> politicizing health issues </s> ingroup vs. outgroup </s> politicizing health issues </s> ingroup vs. outgroup </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> politicizing health issues </s> religion or ideology </s> call to action </s> establishing legitimacy </s> distrusting government or corporations",false,"Muslims in the U.S. are specifically exempted from legislative requirements to purchase health insurance. </s></s> What does this word mean?

If you are a mainstream Christian or a Jew, you need not apply to Opt Out of ObamaCare; that exemption is reserved for Muslims, Scientologists, Amish, Christian Scientists and Native American Indians who have a ""conscientious objection"" to insurance.
Believe it or not, if you are a Muslim you may claim a special religious exemption to Obama-Care that is denied to main-stream Christians and Jews.
Or if you prefer a New-Age religion to Islam, you may become a Scientologist and Opt Out of ObamaCare's mandatory purchase of health insurance.
Or, if you happen to be of Native American Indian extraction you too can opt out of the insurance laws by which everyone else in America must abide. </s></s> using anecdotes and personal experience as evidence </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> freedom of choice and agency </s> using anecdotes and personal experience as evidence </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> freedom of choice and agency </s> religion or ideology </s> less robust evidence or outdated evidence_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be made up </s> using anecdotes and personal experience as evidence </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> freedom of choice and agency </s> politicizing health issues </s> less robust evidence or outdated evidence_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be made up </s> politicizing health issues </s> less robust evidence or outdated evidence_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be made up </s> politicizing health issues </s> less robust evidence or outdated evidence_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be made up </s> highlighting uncertainty and risk </s> politicizing health issues </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> politicizing health issues </s> religion or ideology </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> freedom of choice and agency </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> narrative with details </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> emotional appeals </s> exploiting science’s limitations </s> inappropriate use of scientific and other evidence </s> claims without evidence </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> religion or ideology </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> uppercase words"

47,﻿snes-01085,The FDA has ruled that homeopathic drugs are now illegal,"About 5 million U.S. adults and 1 million U.S. children use homeopathy every year, and the remedies are known to be ""generally safe and unlikely to cause severe adverse reactions,"" according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.1 Yet, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues on its latest crusade, this natural health modality may soon be much harder to come by.
Yet, the FDA is using its limited resources to target the latter, citing a need to ""protect consumers who choose to use homeopathic products."" Why now?
""[I]n one fell swoop, the FDA has declared that virtually every single homeopathic drug on the market is being sold illegally,"" the Alliance for Natural Health USA (ANH USA) wrote5 - and it's not an exaggeration.
The FDA then states that it's proposing a ""new, risk-based enforcement approach"" and first plans to target the ""unapproved drug products labeled as homeopathic that have the greatest potential to cause risk to patients."" This includes:7
Products with reported safety concernsProducts that contain or claim to contain ingredients associated with potentially significant safety concernsProducts for routes of administration other than oral and topicalProducts intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of serious and/or life-threatening diseases and conditionsProducts for vulnerable populationsProducts that do not meet standards of quality, strength or purity as required under the lawFDA Does About-Face, 'Penalizes an Entire Industry'
The draft guidance is a complete turnaround from the FDA's prior stance on homeopathic remedies, which stated, under the 1988 Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 400.400, Conditions Under Which Homeopathic Drugs May be Marketed, they did not need to get FDA approval prior to coming on the market.
By classifying homeopathic drugs as unapproved new drugs, the FDA is requiring a second showing of safety and effectiveness, a step that is unnecessary, not to mention impractical, given that the Agency intends to hold homeopathic products to an allopathic standard that is inappropriate, given the nature of homeopathic products.""
In a notice filed in November 2016, the FTC stated that in order for homeopathic remedies to claim they are effective, their makers must provide proof.
In order to not mislead consumers, the FTC further stated that homeopathic remedies lacking sufficient proof must communicate to consumers that ""the product's claims are based only on theories of homeopathy from the 1700s that are not accepted by most modern medical experts.""10 Dana Ullman, MPH, CCH, one of the leading advocates for homeopathy in the U.S., said at the time:11
In November 2017, however, rather than targeting the prescription opioids that are the root of the opioid epidemic, the FDA issued a public health advisory regarding risks associated with kratom use, suggesting that its usage could ""expand the opioid epidemic."" What this comes down to, for some, is the right to choose what form of ""medicine"" to put in your body.
As for the FDA's new draft guidance on homeopathic drugs, it's attempting to discredit such remedies' proven healing powers before their mechanisms of action have even been fully understood.","establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> rhetorical tricks </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> emotional appeals </s> anger </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> financial motivation </s> rhetorical tricks </s> exaggeration/absolute language </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> establishing legitimacy </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy </s> emotional appeals </s> anger </s> anger </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> ellipses, exaggerated/excessive usage of punctuation marks </s> distinctive linguistic features </s> financial motivation </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> establishing legitimacy </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - medical jargon </s> establishing legitimacy </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> establishing legitimacy </s> surface credibility markers - simply claiming authority or credibility </s> inappropriate analogy or false connection </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source not verified </s> emotional appeals </s> freedom of choice and agency </s> politicizing health issues </s> anger </s> politicizing health issues </s> freedom of choice and agency </s> distrusting government or corporations </s> freedom of choice and agency </s> politicizing health issues",false,"The FDA has ruled that homeopathic drugs are now illegal </s></s> About 5 million U.S. adults and 1 million U.S. children use homeopathy every year, and the remedies are known to be ""generally safe and unlikely to cause severe adverse reactions,"" according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.1 Yet, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues on its latest crusade, this natural health modality may soon be much harder to come by.

The poultry equivalent of ""pink slime"" is really unpleasant stuff
Take a look at the ingredients list of food products including Slim Jims, hot dogs, and other inexpensive meat-based foods that don't need to actually look like meat, and you're bound to encounter mechanically separated chicken or turkey, usually as one of the primary ingredients. The name of this ingredient is pretty ominous - what exactly is being separated, and why are machines needed? - so what exactly is it, and how is it made?
According to the USDA, ""Mechanically separated poultry (MSP) is a paste-like and batter-like poultry product produced by forcing bones, with attached edible tissue, through a sieve or similar device under high pressure to separate bone from the edible tissue,"" which is then treated with a small amount of ammonium hydroxide as an anti-microbial agent. The definition of ""edible tissue"" is stretching it a bit here; it essentially refers to anything left on the bones, including nerves, blood vessels, cartilage, and skin, as well as a small amount of meat. The resulting product is essentially the poultry equivalent of ""lean finely textured beef"" also known as ""pink slime,"" even though the production method is different. Consumption of mechanically separated beef was banned in 2004 due to fear of mad cow disease.
Mechanically separated meat (which also includes pork), is found in plenty of foods, including chicken nuggets and frozen pre-formed chicken patties, but while there's a limit on mechanically separated pork in hot dogs (20 percent), there's no legal limit on mechanically separated chicken in hot dogs, so you may want to check the ingredients list before your next cookout.",distinctive linguistic features </s> title of article as clickbait </s> emotional appeals </s> fear </s> establishing legitimacy </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> establishing legitimacy </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be credible </s> biased reasoning to make a conclusion </s> inappropriate analogy or false connection,true,"Mechanically separated chicken for food </s></s> You've Been Eating Mechanically Separated Chicken and You Don't Even Know It

The name of this ingredient is pretty ominous - what exactly is being separated, and why are machines needed? - so what exactly is it, and how is it made?
According to the USDA, ""Mechanically separated poultry (MSP) is a paste-like and batter-like poultry product produced by forcing bones, with attached edible tissue, through a sieve or similar device under high pressure to separate bone from the edible tissue,"" which is then treated with a small amount of ammonium hydroxide as an anti-microbial agent. The definition of ""edible tissue"" is stretching it a bit here; it essentially refers to anything left on the bones, including nerves, blood vessels, cartilage, and skin, as well as a small amount of meat. The resulting product is essentially the poultry equivalent of ""lean finely textured beef"" also known as ""pink slime,"" even though the production method is different. Consumption of mechanically separated beef was banned in 2004 due to fear of mad cow disease.
Mechanically separated meat (which also includes pork), is found in plenty of foods, including chicken nuggets and frozen pre-formed chicken patties, but while there's a limit on mechanically separated pork in hot dogs (20 percent), there's no legal limit on mechanically separated chicken in hot dogs, so you may want to check the ingredients list before your next cookout. </s></s> politicizing health issues </s> less robust evidence or outdated evidence_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be made up </s> politicizing health issues </s> politicizing health issues </s> less robust evidence or outdated evidence_verified </s> citing source to establish legitimacy_source verified to be made up </s> legitimate persuasive techniques: rhetorical question </s> politicizing health issues"
